<p>I play a lot of 1v1 in Starcraft 2 to practice and work on increasing
 my skill although my favorite thing to do is to play 2v2, 3v3 or 4v4 
with my close friends. Playing on an arranged team has its advantages 
compared to playing random team games. Your team is able to discuss 
strategies before games, and break down what you did wrong and right 
after each game to improve your play.&nbsp; Playing with teammates takes
 the control out of your hands and makes your rely on your team adding a
 degree of difficulty compared to 1v1, although knowing how to work 
together will give you the edge over other teams and help you be 
victorious.</p>

<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>Voice communication is the first thing you should setup before each 
game, the ability to communicate during the game with out typing will 
save you time and make sure your team is on the same page. Using Voice 
chat gives you an advantage from the start in each game as you and your 
team can quickly coordinate attacks, defend each others base and know 
what each other is doing at all times. Having good communication is key 
for any team.</p>
<p>Blizzard has built an in game voice chat system into Starcraft 2 but 
to be honest it is absolutely garbage and the quality is horrible and 
I’ve never been able to get it to work properly.</p>
<p>The voice client my friends and I always use when we play Starcraft 2 is <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a>.
 Skype is a free VOIP client which allows you to communicate with other 
Skype users for free. With Skype you can create a conference call that 
allows you to communicate with up to 4 other Skype users at once, which 
is great for when we play 3v3 or 4v4. The sound quality of Skype is 
crystal clear and is becoming one of the fastest growing voice client 
among gamers since friends can just login to their Skype account and 
start communicating.</p>
<p>The other two popular voice clients are <a href="http://www.ventrilo.com/">Ventrilo</a> and <a href="http://www.teamspeak.com/">TeamSpeak</a>.
 These are both great clients although require you to have a server 
which your friends and you can connect to. The benefit of&nbsp; Ventrilo
 and Teamspeak over Skype is that they allow you to as many players as 
you would like communicating together where Skype only allows up to 5. 
These two clients are often used for Clans with a large amount of users 
or Guilds, although if your just playing with your friends in Starcraft 
you shouldn’t need anymore than 5 users in the voice chat at one time 
which makes Skype the best option.</p>

<h2>Start of the Game</h2>
<p>At the start of each game after you’ve sent your workers to your 
minerals make sure you and your teammates click the icon in the top 
right corner and share unit control with your team. Sharing units with 
your team mates is very important and should be done every game at the 
start of each game, this allows everyone on your team to have control of
 all the units on the map which will be used later on in the game.</p>
<p>The first couple minutes of the game my partners and I talk about our
 strategy and what we plan on doing based off the map we are playing on.
 This is where you and your team want to discuss what units you plan on 
going and how you will want to attack, also if you are going to rush or 
macro till late game.</p>
<p>Early each game have one team member take a worker and scout your 
opponents, you need to know which races they are and possibly see what 
builds they are going early game.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Micro and Macro</h2>
<p>Playing with multiple players adds a lot of variables to the game, 
you and your partner(s) timing have to be in sync and constantly working
 together. In any game you’ll find that one player is better then 
another in certain aspects of the game such as microing and controlling 
units, while the other player may be better at macroing and building up 
his base and army. On every team you want to have one player who handles
 all the Micro and another player who handles all the Macro.</p>
<p><strong>The Micro</strong> – The player who is handles the Micro is 
the player in charge of the army. It is their job to attack and Micro 
the units while attacking. The reason why you have one player control 
the attack is that if one player is controlling all the units during the
 battle he will be able to Micro them all around correctly with out 
having to rely on their partner moving their units in the correct 
position.</p>
<p><strong>The Macro</strong> – The player who handles the Macro is in 
charge of the base up keep of all their allies. While the Micro player 
is attacking they need to make sure that their allies mules are drop, 
Spawn Larva is being used, and Chrono Boost is being used during battle.
 They must also defend off the bases against any attacks while your ally
 is in battle.</p>
<p>The key to the Macro player is making sure while his ally is busy in 
battle that he helps him stay on top of his Macro while he is busy 
controlling the battle.</p>
<hr>
<h2>How my team works</h2>
<p>When I play with my main partner Antiquity I’m always the one in 
charge of the Micro, I handle all the units during the battle and have 
complete control over the army through out the game. While my partner 
makes sure that my Mules are always being casted if I”m Terran or that 
my Queen is always Spawning Larva if I”m Zerg, this is very important 
for me as I don’t always have time to do this while I’m attacking.</p>
<p>When I attack this gives my partner time to start teching out of the 
rush into tier 2. For example my partner always plays as Terran so 
during the initial rush my partner will start building Factories or 
Starports depending on what I tell him we need based off our opponents 
units, unless we are able to push through on the rush I’ll tell him to 
keep unit production on his Marines and Marauders.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Team Chemistry</h2>
<p>Playing with other players in arranged team matches is just like any 
other team, the more you guys play together the more you’ll get to know 
how one another and will develop a chemistry among each other. It is 
important that you play a lot of games to develop this chemistry and 
after a while you guys will start doing things together with out even 
having to say anything. As your team chemistry starts to develop you’ll 
notice that the games become easier when playing with one another and 
most importantly your winning percentage will increase.</p>
<p>Although it is important listen to one another and be able to take 
criticism, after each game it’s a good idea to discuss with your 
partners what you guys did right and what you guys did wrong and how you
 can improve your play next time.</p>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Share Units with your allies at the start of the game</li>
<li>Have on player in charge of controlling the units during battles</li>
<li>Have each player know their role and what they are good at</li>
<li>Share resources with each other if needed</li>
<li>Discuss with your team how you guys played after each match</li>
<li>Learn to take criticism from your teammates and learn from your mistakes</li>
</ul>

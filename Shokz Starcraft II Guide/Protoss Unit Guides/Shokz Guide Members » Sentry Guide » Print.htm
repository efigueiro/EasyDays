<p>The Sentry’s is a Protoss support unit that have a set of great 
special abilities that when used correctly can give you the advantage in
 any battle. You can start producing Sentries from your Gateways as soon
 as you have a Cybernetics Core and for being such an early game unit 
they can be used through out the match into the end game as their skills
 make them useful in any situation.</p>

<h2>Skills and Strategies</h2>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-762" title="force_field" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Sentry%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/force_field.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Force Field</strong>:
 Creates a force field that lasts for 15 seconds and is non-destructible
 wall. Force field only cost 50 energy allowing the Sentry to cast it as
 soon as the Sentry is built.</p>
<p>One of the most common uses of force field is to cast it on your 
base’s ramp to block any opponents from rushing into your base as you 
continue to tech. You can also use the same strategy if you attack your 
opponent and his units are out of his base, you can use force field to 
block off his ramp not allowing his units to enter his base while you 
destroy his structures.</p>
<p>As you become better with Sentries you can start using them in a 
group of 4 – 5 as support to your army, when you are able to engage in 
battle you can spam cast Force Field in the middle of your opponents 
army splitting them in half, so that half of his army is trapped behind 
the force field wall unable to attack while you kill the other half of 
his army.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-763" title="guardian_shield" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Sentry%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/guardian_shield.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Guardian Shield</strong>:
 Creates a ranged aura around the Sentry that reduces income ranged 
damage to friendly units by 2 and lasts for 15 seconds. This is a very 
useful ability and should be used often when you are about to engage in a
 battle with a heavy ranged based army, this ability doesn’t stack with 
one another, but it is a good idea to have a couple Sentries cast it if 
you have a large army so that all your units are inside the Shield.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-764" title="hallucination" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Sentry%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/hallucination.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Hallucination</strong>:
 Creates hallucinations that cannot deal damage, but last for 60 seconds
 and will be revealed by enemy detectors. A very common use of this 
skill is to hallucinate a Phoenix and then fly it over your opponents 
base, this is a great way to scout your opponents base with out wasting 
any minerals as it only cost you energy to produce the hallucination. It
 can also be used to duplicate your army to increase the size right 
before battle in hope that the Hallucinated units will be taking damage 
instead of the real units while they kill your opponents army.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Against other Races</h2>
<p><strong>Vs Protoss</strong>: When facing another Protoss, if you are 
teching to stalkers / immortals then Force Field will be the best option
 to block off the entrance of your base encase your opponent tries to 
Zealot rush you, since force field lasts for 15 seconds you should be 
able to continue to block off your entrance till you are ready to move 
out on him with your army. Guardian Shield will be helpful later on in 
the game if your opponent is going a heavy Stalker build or upgrades to 
Void Rays and even Carriers as the Shield will help reduce any damage by
 your opponent.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Terran</strong>: Force Fields work great against Marine 
and Marauder balls, if you can do a Force Field split and trap half his 
army behind the Force Fields you will only have to deal with half of the
 Marines and Marauders at one time. I also recommend using Guardian 
Shield in almost any battle against Terran since every one of their 
units is a ranged based unit it will help reduce the damage dramatically
 when fighting against their armies.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Zerg</strong>: A lot of Zerg players like to try to do a 
Speedling rush in early games against Protoss where they rush Speedlings
 into your base and attack your minerals, you can do a <a href="http://shokzguide.com/members/protoss-guides/protoss-base-wall-off/">Protoss Wall Off</a>
 or use Force Field to block your entrance not allowing the Speedlings 
into your base as you continue unit production.&nbsp; Using Force Field 
to split up Hydras and Roaches during a battle also works very well 
although should be done around a choke point so that you use the least 
amount of energy possible.</p>

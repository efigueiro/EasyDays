<p>Zealots are the basic unit for Protoss, and is the strongest of the 
starting units for all three races. They are a strong unit in the start 
of the game although as the game progresses they are not as good, but 
with the upgraded Charge ability this makes them useful in certain 
strategies in the late game.</p>
<p>Zealots are most commonly known for Zealot rushes where you build 2 
Gateways and Chrono Boost Zealots to quickly rush your opponent. This is
 a very strong move if the player is not expecting an early rush and 
works very well in the lower level ladder leagues. A lot of players like
 to use a Zealot rush to try to throw their opponent off their Macro 
game and slow them up, they key here is making a couple Zealots around 2
 – 3 and have them sent right to your opponents base as they are made. 
This requires good micro and macro as your goal is to slow your opponent
 down keeping him focused on the small attack while you continue to 
build into your main strategy with out allowing your attack to slow you 
down.</p>

<h2>Skills and Strategies</h2>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-723" title="charge" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Zealot%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/charge.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Charge</strong>:
 Allows the Zealot to intercept nearby enemies by increasing their 
movement speed as they charge in. This skill is auto casted and can be 
used every 10 seconds and is very useful in the late game to quickly 
close the gap between Zealots and ranged units.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Against other Races</h2>
<p><strong>Vs Protoss</strong>: A Zealot rush in Protoss vs Protoss is a
 very strong strategy, since the main factor is who can make more 
Zealots faster, and if they are not ready for a Zealot rush then you 
will have the upper hand on the rush. You only want to do a Zealot rush 
on maps that don’t have a really long rush distance between bases, for 
example Desert Oasis would be a very bad map to do a Zealot rush on 
since the distance between bases is very long, but you could always do a
 Proxy Zealot rush which will be discussed in detail in our Protoss 
Proxy guide coming soon.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Terran</strong>: Zealots are not the strongest when facing
 Terran, it is hard to rush them since most Terran will wall off their 
base and if you try to break down their wall they will just bring a 
couple SCVs over to repair the wall while a Marine or Marauder shoots at
 your Zealots, in this case you would want to wait till mid game and see
 what the Terran player is going, if he is going a heavy Mech build with
 Thors and Tanks then Zealots with Charge would would great.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Zerg</strong>: Zealots are very strong against Zerglings 
as long as they don’t surround you and with a mass amount of numbers, a 
Zealot rush works well against a macro Zerg player who is looking to do 
an early expansion. This is where scouting is very crucial, if you see 
the Zerg is going for an early expansion then you should be able to do a
 good amount of harassment with early Zealots if not win the game. Later
 on in the game Zealots with Charge is a great counter to Hydralisks 
along with Immortals an Stalkers mixed in your army.</p>

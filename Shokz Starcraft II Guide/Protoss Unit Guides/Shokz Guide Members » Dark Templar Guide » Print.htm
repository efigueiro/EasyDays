<p>Dark Templars are a cloaked unit which deals a large amount of 
damage, although if detected can be killed very easily. You don’t see 
Dark Templars often in higher level games since most players in Platinum
 / Diamond league will easily be able to defend against them, although 
in the lower level leagues this is something you have to watch out for 
in late games as a lot of low level protoss players like to try to tech 
to Dark Templars.</p>
<p>I generally would not recommend ever teching right to Dark Templars 
since if your opponent is able to counter them then you will be very far
 behind in the game, although they do work well if you mix in a couple 
in your main army since they can take out other ground units very 
quickly if they go undetected.</p>
<p>If you do go Dark Templars make sure that you hide the Dark Templar 
shrine in the back of your base, or even outside of your base on the 
edge of the map so that your opponent doesn’t see it. If your opponent 
sees the DT Shrine then they will quickly get detectors making your Dark
 Templars useless.</p>

<h2>Against other Races</h2>
<p><strong>Vs Protoss</strong>: Dark Templars are tough to pull off 
against Protoss since they can easily get an observer to fly anywhere on
 the map. In lower level leagues you also see a lot of Protoss players 
placing a Photon Cannon or two at the entrance of their base. A good way
 to get into their base with a couple of Dark Templars is to use a Warp 
Prism and place it down in the back of your opponents base and warp 
them.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Terran</strong>: Terran players have the ability to scan 
anywhere on the map revealing any cloaked units, so instead of using 
Dark Templars to attack your opponents army you can take a couple of 
them straight into their mineral line and have them 1 hit their workers.
 This will help to damage their economy and once they scan you can run 
away from the scan area, to then go back and harass again.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Zerg</strong>: The main detection Zerg will have to reveal
 Dark Templars are Overseers which require a Liar, it’s not likely that 
you’ll be able to get Dark Templars out before the Zerg upgrades to a 
Liar so if you do go Dark Templars against Zerg the best thing to do is 
to wait till you have 4 -6 of them and go straight for their Liar and 
take it out. By the time the morph a Overlord to an Overseer your DTs 
will be able to take out the Liar and you can then work on the rest of 
his base.</p>

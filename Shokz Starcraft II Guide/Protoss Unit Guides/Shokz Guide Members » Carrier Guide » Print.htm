<p>Carriers are on of the most powerful units in the game, they are also
 one of the most expensive. When Carriers are built they are not able to
 attack until you train their Interceptors which are their flying units 
that fly out of the Carrier and attack for you. In almost any game if 
your able to get a good large group of Carriers you will have a big 
advantage as they are one of the hardest units to counter and can take 
out units very quickly and effectively.</p>
<h2>Skills and Strategies</h2>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-812" title="train_interceptors" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Carrier%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/train_interceptors.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Train Interceptors</strong>:
 Builds Interceptors that automatically attack the Carrier’s target.  
Carriers may not attack without Interceptors. Can attack ground and air 
 units. Each Carrier can carry up to 8 Interceptors and they must be 
made from the Carrier before you can attack. They cost 25 minerals each 
which raises the price of the Carrier by an extra 200 minerals.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full  wp-image-811" title="graviton_catapult" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Carrier%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/graviton_catapult.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62"></strong><strong>Graviton Catapult</strong>:
 If you are ever going to mass carriers or get a good number of them 
then make sure to upgrade the Graviton Catapult ability at the Fleet 
Beacon. The upgrade allows the Carrier to launch Interceptors more 
quickly which will improve the amount of DPS the carriers do and is a 
must have upgrade when going Carriers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Carriers require a lot of Minerals and Gas if you go Carriers make 
sure to expand quickly and get up to 3 bases going early with Gas on all
 three.</li>
<li>Carriers come out with the Train Interceptor ability not on 
autocast, which will only train up to 4 in each Carrier, by turning on 
autocast it will allow the Carrier to keep building them until you have 8
 Interceptors.</li>
<li>Build a Mothership to cloak your Carriers, having Carriers alone is a
 huge force to deal with but cloaked Carriers is almost unbeatable.</li>
<li>Upgrade your Carriers Wepaons and armor at the Cybernetics Core, 
have 2 Cybernetic Cores upgrading your Carriers at once to finish the 
upgrades quicker</li>
<li>If you have extra units and your opponent has a lot of ground forces
 then build a couple Colossus, mixed with Carriers this maxes a 
devastating Combo.</li>
</ul>

<p>Colossus are straight out of War of the Worlds, these tall aliens are
 a powerful unit that has the ability to walk up and down cliffs making 
them a great support unit that when in the back of an army shooting down
 the rays of damage they can quickly take out units by the masses. 
Colossus work very well when they are in the back of your army shooting 
over them at your opponent, they are not the most armored unit and when 
focused fired upon they go down quickly.</p>

<h2>Skills and Strategies</h2>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-784" title="cliff_walk" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Colossus%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/cliff_walk.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Cliff Walk</strong>:
 Colossus can walk up and down cliffs allowing them to quickly move 
across the map with out any obstacles getting in their way. This is 
makes the Colossus great harassment units on most maps you’ll be able to
 access your opponents main base or expansions from a cliff or ledge 
which you can use the colossus to get behind your their minerals and 
start taking out their workers and then once they bring their units over
 to defend their base you can walk your Colossus back over the cliff.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-785" title="extended_thermal_lances" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Colossus%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/extended_thermal_lances.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Extended Thermal Lances</strong>:
 This is an upgrade from the Robotics Facility which increases the range
 of your Colossus weapon. This is a great upgrade if your plan on using a
 heavy Colossus build since it will allow them to stand even further 
back when they are attacking, this will help reduce the threat of the 
Colossus being focused fired since they will have to walk through your 
main ground forces just to reach them, it is also helpful to allow 
Colossus to stand on a nearby ledge while in battle to stay out of range
 of enemy units.</p>

<li>Use Colossus to Walk over cliffs and Harass your opponents expansions</li>
<li>Air unit can attack Colossus make sure you have some type of Anti-Air to protect them from vikings and other air units</li>
</ul>

<h2>Against other Races</h2>
<p><strong>Vs Protoss</strong>: When playing against another Protoss 
player Colossus work great since most Protoss armies are ground base. 
Colossus are very strong against Zealot and Stalker combos, the main 
thing you will want to watch out for are Immortals as they can take down
 a Colossus very quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Terran</strong>: Colossus will absolultey destroy Marine 
and Marauder balls, if your Terran player is going a very heavy infantry
 build with Marines and Marauders then a good sized ground units with a 
couple Colossus to back them up will be one of the best counters you can
 go. You need to watch out for Vikings, they have very long range and 
can shoot down the Colossus from a distance. If you see your opponent is
 getting Vikings to counter the Colossus then use Stalkers to focus fire
 them down before they can take out the Colossus.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Zerg</strong>: Like with the other two races this will be 
dependent on what the Zerg player goes. If they go a quick Zergling into
 Mutalisks than stay away from Colossus as the Mutalisks will be a 
strong counter to them. If the Zerg opponent goes with a Hydra / Roach 
based army then Colossus backing up Stalkers / Zealots will be the best 
route. Upgraded with Thermal Lance they will be able to out range the 
Zerg units and take them down quickly with their splash damage.</p>

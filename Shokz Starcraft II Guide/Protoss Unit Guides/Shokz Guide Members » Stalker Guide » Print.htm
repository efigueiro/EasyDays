<p>Stalkers are the replacement of the Dragoon from the original 
Starcraft, they are a ranged unit that does well in numbers and can be 
used to harass your opponent through the game with their upgraded Blink 
ability. Stalkers are also one of Protoss’s strongest anti-air unit and 
should be used in almost all cases when in need of anti-air and dealing 
with any type of air / ranged unit.</p>

<h2>Skills and Strategies</h2>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-753" title="blink" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Stalker%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/blink.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Blink</strong>:
 is an upgraded that is researched from the Twilight Council that gives 
the Stalker the ability to teleport to a nearby location, with a 10 
second cool down. When ever you plan to go a heavy Stalker build you 
should always research Blink as it can be very useful when you learn how
 to use it correctly. You can use blink to quickly close the gap between
 range units and most importantly air units, by Blinking under an air 
attack such as Banshees or Void Rays allow all your stalkers to get in 
range to attack the air units instantly rather then having to walk in 
range while being attacked.</p>
<p>A very useful strategy with blink is base harassing, as long as you 
have sight of a ledge you can blink into your opponents base from the 
sides or the back and attack his harvesters, than once his units come to
 defend them you can blink out of the base. You can continue to keep up 
this pressure while you build up your force and are ready to attack, 
this also works well in harassing their expansions and trying to take 
them out of their game psychologically.</p>

<li>When facing a Terran with Siege Tanks Blink next to his Siege tanks to quickly take them out.</li>
<li>Against Brood Lords Blink underneath them putting you in range to attack them directly</li>
<li>Use a couple of Stalkers with Blink to harass our opponents expansion and Main’s economy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Against other Races</h2>
<p><strong>Vs Protoss</strong>: Stalkers work well against Protoss if 
you mix them in with some Zealots, you don’t want to just go Stalkers 
unless you see that your opponent is teching to Void Rays, a lot of 
Protoss players will try to build mass Void Rays to win which will be 
easily countered by Stalkers. Stalkers with Immortals / Collossus work 
very well together also and if your opponent is getting a lot of 
Stalkers then Immortals will help easily take them out.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Terran</strong>: Stalkers are a great choice against 
almost any Terran player, if they are going a with a Marine and Marauder
 Ball then a mix of Stalkers, Zealots, Immortals, and Colossus will be 
the best counter. If they go a Mech build with Siege Tanks and Thors you
 can use blink to quickly get on top of the Siege tanks and then destroy
 the Thors, and since Terran has the strongest air force in the game 
Stalkers and Phoenixes will be the best option to counter any air units 
such as Banshee and Battlecruisers.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Zerg</strong>: In early game against Zerg I try to get a 
lot of Zealots, compared to stalkers till you can see what the Zerg 
player is going since Zerglings can easily surround stalkers. Once you 
see his build if he is going into a Roach / Hydra based build then 
Stalkers with Immortals will be the best counter or if he does a 
Mutalisk rush / Tech then Stalkers and Phoenixes will counter the 
Mutalisks, you can also use Blink to get close to Mutas when they are 
attacking / fleeing from your base.</p>

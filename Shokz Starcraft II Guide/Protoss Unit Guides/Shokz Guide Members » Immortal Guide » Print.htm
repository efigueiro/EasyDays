<p>Immortals are an armored unit which do an insane amount of damage to 
armored units and buildings. They have a Hardened Shields that reduce 
damage to their shields from any heavy attack and provide great support 
to a Zealot and Stalker based army.</p>

<h2>Skills and Strategies</h2>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-776" title="force_field" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Immortal%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/force_field1.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Hardened Shield</strong>:
 The Immortal’s Hardened Shields reduce the damage of incoming high 
damage attacks to 10 if his shields are still up. This is a great 
ability, if your Immortals have their shields then any heavy damage will
 be reduce to only 10, for example if a Siege Tank hits an Immortal that
 has their shield up instead of doing their normal damage of 60 they 
will only do 10 damage to the Immortals shields. The same goes for 
roaches, instead of the normal 16 damage a Roach would do the shield 
will only take 10 damage per hit from a Roach.</p>

<h2>Against other Races</h2>
<p><strong>Vs Protoss</strong>: Immortals are a great counter to a heavy
 stalker build, if your opponent is going mainly stalkers then going 
Immortals will take them out quickly, although you have to watch out for
 Zealots as they are a strong counter against Immortals. Immortals are 
also great against Colossus if your able to get in range of them, if 
your opponent goes Colossus and Stalkers Immortals will be the best 
counter, just make sure that you focus fire down the Colossus quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Terran</strong>: One of the hardest things to counter in 
the Terran army are well placed Siege Tanks, Immortals are great against
 them long as they have their shields. Siege Tanks only do 10 damage to 
the Immortals while the Immortals does extra damage to Siege Tanks 
taking them out very quickly. Along with Siege Tanks, Immortals are 
great counters to Marauders and provide great support when going against
 a Marine/Marauder ball. The thing you have to watch out for when 
playing against Terran are ghost, if they get an EMP off on your 
Immortals that will instantly destroy their shields leaving them 
vulnerable to attack.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Zerg</strong>: Immortals are the easiest counter to 
Roaches, you don’t find many players going a very heavy roach army 
anymore due to all the nerfs they received but when a player does go 
roaches then Immortals will be the best choice to counter them. The 
Immortals weakness against Zerg are Zerglings, they are small and quick 
and can easily surround an Immortal taking him down quickly. If you are 
to go a Immortal build to counter roaches some Zealots so that they can 
handle any Zerglings that they throw at you.</p>

<p>High Templars have one of the most powerful spells in the game with 
Psionic Storm, using High Templars requires a decent amount of Micro 
while battling although if you can control them right and get off a 
couple Psionic Storms you will usually always come out on top in the 
battle. The High Templar is a casting unit only and cannot do any damage
 once it is out of energy, although as a last resort you are able to 
take two High Templars are morph them into Archons to help with a final 
stand.</p>

<h2>Skills and Strategies</h2>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-758" title="psionic_storm" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20High%20Templar%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/psionic_storm.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Psionic Storm</strong>:
 Creates a storm of psionic energy that last for 4 seconds causing up to
 80 damage to all units in the targeted area. Psionic Storm works great 
when your opponent has a lot of units grouped up in a ball, the closer 
the units are together the more effective Psionic Storm will be. If you 
are going to go High Templars I usually go with atleast 3 or 4 so that I
 can spam Psionic Storm on my opponent once we engage in battle.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-757" title="feedback" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20High%20Templar%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/feedback.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Feedback</strong>:
 Purgest all energy from the target, dealing 1 damage per point of 
energy. This skill isn’t used very often since Psionic Storm is what 
most people save their energy for, although this can be useful if your 
opponent has a strong casting unit such as a Mothership, Raven, or 
Infestors. The key is to drain their energy so that they cannot use 
those units to cast any spells that can turn the tide of the battle.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-756" title="archon_warp" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20High%20Templar%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/archon_warp.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Archon Warp</strong>:
 Sacrifices two High Templars to create an Archon. Blizzard made Archons
 a lot weaker in Starcraft 2 than in the original, the reason behind 
this is that they don’t want players to make Archons as a normal build, 
but instead build them after your High Templars energy has been used and
 you need a little extra fighting power. The only real use for Archons 
now is if after a battle your opponent is barley winning you can morph 
your High Templars into Archons to help give you a little extra boost.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set your High Templars to a Control Group so you can quickly select them and cast Psionic Storm at the start of the battle</li>
<li>use High Templars in a heavy Stalker based army so that you don’t cast Psionic Storm on your Zealots</li>
<li>Use Feedback on any casting unit that could potentially damage your army</li>
<li>Morph two High Templars into Archons after using their energy to give you an extra unit to engage in battle.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Against other Races</h2>
<p><strong>Vs Protoss</strong>: High Templars are not very effective 
against other Protoss plaeyrs, unless the go mass Stalkers. If you end 
up going late game and your opponent gets a Mothership then getting a 
High Templar or two to use Feedback on the Mothership is a good idea, 
but I tend to normally stay away from High Templars when playing against
 Protoss.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Terran</strong>: High Templars work great against Terran 
players who go the Marine / Marauder combo since they keep them grouped 
up in a tight ball and are easily exposed to Pisonic Storm, a lot of 
Terran players who go with Marines / Marauder usually also go Medivacs 
to heal their units which you can then cast Feedback on the Medivacs to 
drain their energy leaving them useless.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Zerg</strong>: Zerg is similar to Terran, they both have 
units which are packed tightly in large numbers. High Templars work 
great against a Zerg player who masses Roaches or Hydralisks, if your 
able to cast a a couple of Psionic Storm on the Zergs army you can 
quickly take them out if they don’t move out of the way of the Psionic 
Storm.</p>

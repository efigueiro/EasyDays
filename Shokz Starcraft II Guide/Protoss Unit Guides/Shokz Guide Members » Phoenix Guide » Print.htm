<p>The Phoenix is a light weight flying unit which can attack while on 
the move. Their attack isn’t very strong and other than killing 
Overlords I don’t really use them as a attack unit, they do have one 
ability Graviton Beam that makes them useful and if you use them 
correctly can be pretty powerful.</p>

<h2>Skills and Strategies</h2>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-800" title="graviton_beam" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Phoenix%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/graviton_beam.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Graviton Beam</strong>:
 Makes the target unit float into the air disabling its abilities. The 
effect last up to 10 seconds and cannot be used on massive units. This 
skill is the one of the only reasons to make Phoenixes, it works great 
if you want to harass your opponent, you can take a couple of them to 
their mineral line and Graviton Beam their workers 1 by 1 allowing your 
other Phoenixes to kill them once you pull them up into the air. This is
 also a very useful skill to disable special units during battle such as
 ghost, or powerful units such as Immortals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Graviton Beam to harass opponents workers</li>
<li>You can Graviton a Zerg player’s Queen while other Phoenixes kill her</li>
<li>Phoenixes can attack while moving so you can kite other air units by constantly moving around them while attacking</li>
</ul>

<h2>Against other Races</h2>
<p><strong>Vs Protoss</strong>: One of the best uses of Phoenixes when 
playing against another Protoss is when they go Immortals, you can use 
the Phoenixes to lift the Immortals in the air for 10 seconds during 
battle leaving them useless while your is attacking theirs.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Terran</strong>: Just like with Protoss you can use the 
Phoenixes to Graviton Beam battle changing opponents such as Siege Tanks
 and Ghost. Removing Siege Tanks form a battle will give you a huge 
advantage in the fight and will give you time to kill their forces 
before the Siege tanks can even attack. You can also use Phoenixes to 
harass your opponent by beaming up their mules and having other 
Phoenixes shoot them down, hurting their economy.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Zerg</strong>: Phoenixes are an alright counter to 
Mutalisks although I prefer to go Stalkers with blink if my opponent is 
going to mass Mutalisks. They do work great though harassing the Zergs 
base, you can beam up the Zerg’s Queen while your other Phoenixes kill 
her and then start taking out their drones. If you plan on going 
Phoenixes against Zerg use them mainly as harassing units and make sure 
you put most of your resources into your army.</p>

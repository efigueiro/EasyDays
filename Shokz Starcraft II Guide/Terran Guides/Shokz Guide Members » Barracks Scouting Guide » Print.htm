<p>A lot of times while playing Terran after your first SCV scout you 
won’t be able to get another unit into your enemies base to see what 
they are building so your stuck with the only logical option and that is
 to Scan them, but no! This is the last thing you will want to do early 
game as using your mule is more important since the mule will get you 
around 300 minerals.</p>
<p>So the best thing to do when trying to scout your opponents base mid 
game is to build a barracks on the side of his base and then fly it in 
over the base to scout. A barracks only cost 150 minerals so you will be
 saving 150 minerals by not scanning and a barracks has a lot of hp 
which will allow you to float it over their base for a long period of 
time before they can destroy it.</p>

<h2>Where to Build Barracks</h2>
<p>When you build your scouting Barracks you want to build it on the 
outside of their base on a side where they will not scout or see it 
until it’s built, although you want to build where it will have the 
quickest path into their base so it doesn’t have to fly a long way to 
reveal their builds.</p>

<h2>Scouting</h2>
<p>Once your barracks is complete you will want to lift off and just fly
 it over their base to see what units they have and what buildings they 
have so you can then build to counter what ever build order they have 
gone. A lot of times they will have a few anti air units although it 
won’t be enough to take down the barracks so after you’ve scouted their 
base and gained all the info you need then float your barracks out of 
there and land it on a cliff near by where you can then use it scout 
later in the game.</p>

<p>Reapers are a light weight Terran unit which has the ability to jump 
up and down from cliffs. This gives the reaper the unique ability to 
quickly travel anywhere on the map quickly as they don’t have to follow 
the normal path. Reapers are commonly used as an early game rush unit to
 harass your opponents minerals and destroy their economy giving your 
the early game advantage.</p>
<p>Reapers as a stand alone unit are generally very weak and you won’t 
see them in an army composition as they have light armor, low hp, and 
die very easily. Although if you know how to use them correctly they can
 excel and be one of the most beneficial units through out the 
game.&nbsp; We are going to look at the build orders for reaper rushes, 
how to use them during the rush and how they can still be used mid to 
late game.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Rush Preparation</h2>
<p>When doing a Reaper rush you want to get the Reaper out as fast as 
possible so that you are in your opponents base before he has any units 
to defend.</p>
<p><strong>Scouting</strong> – When Reaper Rushing make sure you scout 
your opponent in the very early game with an SCV so you know his 
location. Once your Reaper is ready you want to be able to go straight 
to their base and not worry about finding where your opponent is on the 
map. If your playing a map with only two spawn locations then you will 
know where he is although if your on a map with more than 2 spawn points
 then you will need to scout early game.</p>

<p><strong>Base Build</strong> – When going the Reaper rush build make 
sure you build your Barracks and Supply Depot next to your ramp to wall 
of your base. If your Reaper rush fails you and your opponent counters 
having your base walled off will allow you to defend against the 
counter.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Build Order</h2>
<p>9 – Barracks</p>
<p>Once you reach 9 supply save 150 minerals and build a barracks, as 
soon as the barracks is complete build a Tech Lab onto the barracks</p>
<p>9 – Refinery</p>
<p>Once you start building your Barracks save 75 minerals and build a 
refinery while still at 9 supply. You will need enough gas for a Tech 
lab once your barracks is complete along with gas for your reapers so 
put 3 SCVs mining gas once the refinery is complete</p>
<p>10 – Supply Depot</p>
<p>You want to build your first supply depot at 10 or 11 supply the key 
is having your first Supply Depot done before the Tech Lab is finished 
so you can instantly start building your first Reaper.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Controlling the Reapers</h2>
<p>Once your Barracks is complete and you start building your first 
Reaper set your rally point of your Barracks to the outside of your 
opponents base that so your Reaper will start traveling there right 
away. Once your first Reaper is created set him to a Control Group such 
as 1 so you can quickly access him. You will also want to set a hot key 
your Barracks so you can access it and continue to make Reapers while 
Microing your first Reaper in your opponents base.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-375" title="ReaperInTerranMinerals" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Reaper%20Rush%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/ReaperInTerranMinerals-e1276408012802.jpg" alt="" height="274" width="660"></p>
<p><strong>Back of the Base </strong>- When you are ready to attack you 
want to go in through the side of your opponents base where you think he
 will not have any units so you can quickly get to his minerals. Stay 
along the wall and out of sight of where he would place any units and go
 straight behind his mineral line and focus fire his workers.</p>
<p><strong>Group of Reapers</strong> – A lot of times I like to wait 
till I get at least 3 – 4 Reapers before I go into their base that way I
 can one shot their Mineral workers and take a lot of very quickly. 
Another reason for waiting until you get 3 – 4 Reapers is that once he 
sees you have gone a Reaper rush your opponent will build to counter it 
and within a minute he will have the correct counter and 1 reaper 
usually won’t be enough to take him out. Although if you have 3 – 4 
Reapers you’ll be able to enough damage before he can counter.</p>
<p><strong>Reaper Kite </strong>- Reapers are very fast and if Micro 
correctly you can kite your opponent’s early game units. For example if 
your playing a Protoss you can kite a Zealot by running the Reaper a 
couple yards away and then shooting at the Zealot and then running away 
again, continue to this process without letting the Zealot catch the 
Reaper.</p>
<p><strong>Using the Cliffs </strong>- When attacking your opponents 
base you want to make sure you use your cliffs to your advantage. If the
 back of your opponents mineral line is near a cliff jump up and attack 
his workers, when he brings his units then jump back down and then enter
 his base from a different location, to draw his units to the new spot 
and then jump back down and head back to his mineral line. By doing this
 your keeping pressure on him while hopefully damaging his economy and 
killing his mineral workers.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Reapers Mid to Late Game</h2>
<p>Rapers are mainly used for early game rush but they can also be used 
during the mid to late game. Now they are not a unit that you want to 
use in battle mid to late game but can be used as a distraction and to 
help prevent your opponent from expanding.</p>
<p>The key is keeping your Reapers separated from your army and keeping 
your opponent on the move. If your opponent is expanding somewhere on 
the map you can use your Reapers to attack his expansion and when he 
brings his army to attack you can then move in on his base with your 
main force.</p>
<p>Another key strategy is to wait till you get into a battle with your 
opponent and then take your Reapers into his base and take out his 
workers on the Mineral line. Since your opponents army is currently in 
battle with you he won’t be able to defend his units and most players 
will focus on the battle rather then their base. They key to this is 
having your Rapers hot keyed so you can quickly select them and send 
them right into your opponents base while in the middle of a battle.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Transition into Macro</h2>
<p>They purpose of the Reaper rush is hurt your opponents economy and 
get them out of their normal play build. Although you also need to be 
able to transition into a mid game since it is rare that you’ll win the 
game with Reapers alone. Make sure before you attack with your Reapers 
you have your Command Center hot keyed so you can continue to produce 
SCVs and new units.</p>
<p>Make sure that during the attack you continue to build units such as 
Marauders or start building a Factory / Starport depending on what you 
would like to transition into. The key is having units being built and 
keep up with your Macro while attacking. The worst thing you can do 
attack and let your minerals build up so that once your attack is 
finished you have 1000+ minerals and no units.</p>

<p>A Mule is a advance gathering unit which you summon down from your 
Orbital Command Center. They cost 50 energy and last for 90 seconds, 
over the course of the 90 second they are able to gather 260 – 300 
minerals.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Orbital Command Center</h2>
<p>When playing as Terran you want to get your Orbital Command as soon 
as possible as mules are one of the most important units in the Terran 
Economy. I always try to get my Orbital Command around 14 supply and 
will very depending on your build order.&nbsp; Once you get your Orbital
 Command you can use the Energy one of three things, a Mule, Scan, and a
 Supply Drop which increases your supply limit.</p>
<hr>
<h2>When to use Mules</h2>
<p>In short you should use Mules every time you have the energy. Terran 
with out mules will trail in resource gathering almost every game and 
mules give you the advantage you need to keep up with a high Macro Zerg.
 Any time you have 50 energy you should be casting mules down on your 
minerals instead of using your Orbital command energy on a Scan or 
Supply Drop.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-255" title="Mass Mules" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Using%20Mules%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/Mass-Mules.jpg" alt="" height="240" width="596"></p>
<p>The bottom line is 300 minerals is more important then a scan or a supply drop.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why the others are a Waste of Energy</h2>
<p><strong>Scan </strong>- While this is a useful skill you should only 
use it if you need to scan for cloaked units while in battle. Many 
players like to use this to scout their opponent and see what they are 
building, although just run a unit into their base to scout instead, or 
many pro players will build a barracks and fly it over their opponents 
base. A barracks only cost 150 minerals where not casting a mule will 
cost you 300.</p>
<p><strong>Supply Drop</strong> – This should only be used if you are 
supply blocked and have to produce units, you never want to use this in a
 normal game as a Supply Depot only cost 100 minerals and you should 
always have 1 SCV building Supply Depots for you and by doing this your 
wasting 300 minerals when you can spend 100 on another Supply Depot.</p>
<hr>
<h2>How to use Mules</h2>
<p>The first thing you should always do at the start of each game is set
 your Command Center to a Control Group hot key. I like to set mine to 
5, this way you can quickly access it through out the game. The Hot key 
for a Mule is “E” so during the game I can double tap 5 to select and be
 taken to my Orbital Command Center, hit “E” and cast down a mule onto 
my Minerals.</p>
<p>When you cast a mule down make sure to cast it onto a Mineral and not
 just next to your Mining Field. By casting the mule onto a mineral 
patch it will auto start mining once it lands where if you cast it just 
near a mining field you manually have to click it onto a mining patch to
 start harvesting.<br>

<hr>
<h2>Getting the Most out of Mules</h2>
<p>When you take a look at a Mineral patch they are not all an even 
distance from your Command Center, there are a few that are closer and a
 few that are farther away. By casting the mule down on the closest 
mineral patch near your command center it will allow you to get an extra
 trip in before the mule expires this will add an extra 60 minerals per 
mule cast.</p>

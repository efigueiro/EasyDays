<p>A Build Order is the order in  which you construct your buildings, 
units, or research upgrades. Build  orders are often numbered by the 
supply count at which something is  built, but can also simply be based 
in chronological order. For example,  a “10 gate” is a gateway made when
 you have 10 probes. This could be  followed up with a cybernetics core 
“immediately afterward”, meaning as  soon as the gateway is completed, 
but at no particular supply count.</p>
<p>This is just the start and I will be adding a lot more build orders each day.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Standard Terran Build Order</h2>
<p>10/11 -&gt; Supply Depot at Choke<strong> -&gt;</strong> Hotkey this worker to 2 <strong>-&gt;</strong> Scout<br>
11/11 -&gt; As the Depot finishes, build a Barracks next to it to block choke<br>
13/19 -&gt; Build a second Depot next to the Barracks, sealing the choke</p>
<p>This standard opener seals your main from scouts completely. Unless 
the  opponent decides to send a scout very early they won’t be able to 
scout  you at all. This would be a disadvantage for them because they’d 
be  removing a worker at 6 or 7 supply, effectively putting them behind 
by  almost a minute. So with this opener you just won’t be scouted.</p>
<p>15/19 -&gt; Right as the Barracks finishes, build one Marine<br>
17/19 -&gt; As the 16 SCV finishes (your marine makes 17 supply) upgrade Command Center to Orbital Command (OC)<br>
17/19 -&gt; During the upgrade, build one Refinery<br>
17/19 -&gt; Supply Depot<br>
17/19 -&gt; Put down your second Barracks</p>
<hr>
<h2>Fast Banshee Build against Protoss</h2>
<p>9/11 -&gt; Supply Depot<br>
11/11 -&gt; As the Depot finishes, build a Barracks<br>
13/19 -&gt; Build your first Refinery, have 3 SCVs gathering once finished<br>
14/19 -&gt; Upgrade your Command Center to an Orbital Command<br>
15/19 -&gt; Build your Second Refinery</p>
<p>While doing this produce a couple marines to defend behind your base’s wall.</p>
<p>16/19 -&gt; Build your Factory</p>
<p>Once the Factory is finished toss down two Starports and once the 
Starports are finished swap them both out with your Factory’s and 
Barracks Tech Lab and start producing your Banshees.</p>
<hr>
<h2>11 Starport Banshee Rush Build Order</h2>
<p>9 /11 -&gt; Refinery<br>
10 /11 -&gt; Build Barracks at your base’s ramp<br>
11/11 -&gt; Factory with Tech Lab next to your Barracks blocking off the entrance into your base<br>
11/11 -&gt; Orbital Command and use a mule once finished<br>
11/11 -&gt; Starport<br>
11/11 -&gt; Supply Depot</p>
<p>Once the Starport is finished lift up your swap out your Starport and
 Factory so that your Starport can use the Tech Lab from your factory 
that you already built to start producing Banshees right away.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Reaper Rush Defense Build Order</h2>
<p>The point of this build order is to defend against a Reaper rush, the
 best counter for Reapers with early Terran are Marauders to you need to
 be able to get the Marauders out just as quick as the Reapers.</p>
<p>9/11 –&gt; Barracks<br>
9/11 –&gt; Refinery, once finished add an additional 2 guys to harvest gas<br>
10/11 –&gt; Supply Depot<br>
10/11 -&gt; Build a Tech lab onto your Barracks, you want to do this as soon as your barracks has finished building.</p>
<p>Once your Tech Lab is finished on your Barracks pump out your first 
Marauder, this will allow you to defend against any Reapers harassment 
by keeping him back in your mineral line. You can also upgrade 
Concussive shells from the Tech Lab which will slow the movement speed 
down of any Reaper allowing the Marauder to easily kill him.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Fast Double Orbital Expand Build Order (Vs Protoss)</h2>
<p>A creative opening that sacrifices any kind of Army or Tech for a 
very  fast Eco advantage. It gets you the advantages of having two 
Orbital  Commands but your follow-up is very dependent on the Protoss.</p>
<p>10/11 -&gt; Supply Depot<br>
12/19 -&gt; Barracks<br>
16/19 -&gt; Orbital Command<br>
18/19 -&gt; Command Center (2) once complete upgrade to Orbital Command</p>
<ul>
<li>Calldown: Supply</li>
</ul>
<p>19/19 -&gt; Build 2 Refineries</p>
<p>From this build’s get-go you’re constantly adapting to your opponent.
  Make sure you get as much info as you can on his army size and  
composition. With two Orbital Commands you also have additional scans  
you can use.</p>

<p>The Void rays are a problem. It took me about 20 losses to find a Build<br>
that could handle the void rays and still be able to transition over to handle other<br>
Protoss units.</p>
<p>This consists of 3 things.</p>
<p>Macro: Be aware of cliffs. Dont build wall and dont build near cliffs.<br>
Cliffs Are what makes the power of Void Rays so big. And a skilled player will<br>
use all his voidrays over cliffs or near them.</p>
<p>Micro: Marines are essential for handling Void Rays. A marine without stim<br>
Is no good against a voidray. And a overstimmed Marine suck against Voidrays.</p>
<p>Scouting: The initial build of a Protoss player will tell you about what strategy he is going.<br>
Seeing the signs is important. For this reticular strat (Void Rays) the Protoss will go double<br>
Gas. so this is something to look for. Also his amount of Gateways can be a tell. If he ha<br>
2 Assimilators and only one gateway, this is a great tell that he is teching for Voids.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-181" title="VoidRayonMarines" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Defending%20againts%20Void%20Rays%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/VoidRayonMarines.jpg" alt="" height="264" width="596"></p>
<p>Now over to the build:</p>
<p>10X Supply Depot<br>
12X Barraks<br>
13X Gas<br>
14X Marine<br>
15X Uppgrade barraks (Tech Lab)<br>
15X Uppgrade Command senter.<br>
15-16X Second Gas</p>
<p>Pretty standard so far. By this time you should have a certain ideah of<br>
what his strat is from the “Tells” when scouting his base. Gateway(s)<br>
Assimilator(s)</p>
<p>As for now i wont show the amount of Scv’s<br>
1x Marauder<br>
1x Uppgrade Stim (Important!)<br>
1x Barraks<br>
1x Marauder</p>
<p>At this time you have to make the choise depending on your scouting/gut feeling.<br>
Will he go voidrays or not? If you cant get into his base with an SCV look at his unit<br>
composition. What is he spending his gas on? Is there a sentry there? How many stalkers?<br>
(3 or more stalkers id say he wont go “fast” voidrays.)</p>
<p>If voidrays.</p>
<p>3rd Barrak<br>
2nd Barrak uppgrade to Reactor.</p>
<p>Now you should have:<br>
2x Marauders<br>
1x Marines<br>
1x Barrak with Teck Lab researching stim. Producing marines<br>
1x Barrak with Reactor producing Marines<br>
1x barrak Producing marines.</p>
<p>When his First void ray comes make shure that your<br>
Stim pack is researched. If not dont attack the voidray.<br>
Once the stim is ready. you will have about 8x-9x marines<br>
Keep producing em. Stim Attack move attack move Towards the<br>
Void ray. If he doesn’t run with it he looses it.</p>
<p>Now try this and work on it with a friend with skills in protoss<br>
play.</p>

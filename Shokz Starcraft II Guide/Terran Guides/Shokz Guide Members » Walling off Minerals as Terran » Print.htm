<h2>Walling off Minerals</h2>
<p>As Terran it is almost always a good idea to wall off the entrance base which is discussed in the <a href="http://shokzguide.com/members/terran-guides/walling-off-your-base-as-terran/">Walling off Base as Terran Guide</a>. Although as Terran you may also want to wall off your mineral line.</p>
<p>The reason for doing this is so you can units such as zerglings, 
hellions, or any other ground unit running straight into your mineral 
line while your base is under attack and killing off your economy.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-262" title="MineralWallDown2" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Walling%20off%20Minerals%20as%20Terran%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/MineralWallDown2.jpg" alt="" height="299" width="596"></p>
<p>Most of the time as Terran players when you are building Supply 
Depots you build them to the side of your base and out of the way in a 
nice orderly stack to take up as little room as possible, although why 
not use them as an extra level of defense since you have to build them 
anyway.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Supply Depot Mineral Wall</h2>
<p>To Wall off your mineral line you want to build a wall of Supply 
Depots from your Command Center to your Refinery or the end mineral 
patch. You will need to do this on both sides of your command center.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-261" title="MineralWall1" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Walling%20off%20Minerals%20as%20Terran%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/MineralWall1.jpg" alt="" height="312" width="596"></p>
<p>With most mineral patches there is usually a gap or two in the 
minerals where a unit can slide through so you will want to build a 
Supply Depot or two behind your minerals to close it off completely.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Raising and Lowering the Wall</h2>
<p>Once you have your mineral wall up you will still want to be able to 
get SCVs out of your minerals so you can create structures and not let 
the wall get in your way of your base Macro. So the best thing to do is 
keep your mineral wall down, but setting your mineral wall to a Control 
Group hot key such as “9″ so you can quickly access all the Supply 
Depots in your mineral wall and hit “R” to raise them and protect your 
harvesters.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-260" title="MineralWallDown" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Walling%20off%20Minerals%20as%20Terran%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/MineralWallDown.jpg" alt="" height="306" width="596"></p>
<p>To set your entire mineral wall to a control group double click on 
one of the Supply Depots and it will Select all the Supply Depots in 
your mineral wall which you can then click on Control “9″ to set all 
those Supply Depots to that Control Group so you can quickly access them
 incase of a base attack.</p>

<h2>Knowing When to Expand</h2>
<p>As a Terran player one of the difficult decisions is knowing when to 
expand. Most Terran players usually wall them selves in their base as 
they build up their forces, although sitting behind your wall for to 
long can allow your opponent to get map control and simply wear you out 
until you have no resources left as they continue to expand across the 
map and control the game.</p>
<p>In all games you want to keep a little pressure on your opponent and 
be the aggressor rather then on the defensive the entire game, if you 
keep the pressure on you opponent and are unable to break through his 
forces and take him out then you will need to match him in economy as 
you continue to build units.&nbsp; What this means is if you see that 
your opponent is expanding, you either need to making a timing attack 
and take him out, or you must expand also to keep up with the economy.</p>

<h2>How to Expand</h2>
<p>Terran’s defense relies a lot on walling off their base and by 
building an you command center out in your natural usually leaves it 
open for attack, this is why as Terran players you want to always build 
your expansion inside your base on the edge near your expansion. By 
doing this you will not have to worry about defending it while it is 
being built and it will give you more time to get more forces to defend 
it one you actually do fly it out to the expansion.</p>

<h2>Orbital Command First</h2>
<p>In most games when you expand to your natural you want to build an 
Orbital Command center, rather then a Fortress as your natural expansion
 is right next to your base and will be easy to defend. So when you 
finish your Command Center in your base, build the Orbital Command 
Center onto it right away while still in your base this way you will 
have the 50 energy to use right away on a mule instead of waiting for it
 to build once you land the Command Center in the expansion.</p>

<p>Once you have your expansion setup you will want to then build your 
defense at your expansions choke rather then the ramp into your base. 
You can setup some seige tanks around your expansion with your units in 
front.</p>
<p>When expanding away from your base as Terran it’s a good idea to 
build a Fortress onto the Command Center instead of the Orbital Command 
so it has some defense if it is going to take some time for your units 
to get to it’s location to help defend it.</p>

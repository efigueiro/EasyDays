<p>So I figure it’s about time I lay out my Terran build for everyone 
since  I’ve been playing Terran so much and I feel my opener is pretty 
strong  at this point (keep in mind that every SCV who is working should
 be  queued to mine after it’s finished):</p>
<p><strong>(NOTE: Newer players, 10/11 means your tenth SCV is finished and you have 11 supply, so on and so forth.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>10/11 -&gt;</strong> Supply Depot at Choke<strong> -&gt;</strong> Hotkey this worker to 2 <strong>-&gt;</strong> Scout<br>
<strong>11/11 -&gt;</strong> As the Depot finishes, build a Barracks next to it to block choke<br>
<strong>13/19 -&gt;</strong> Build a second Depot next to the Barracks, sealing the choke</p>
<p>This standard opener seals your main from scouts completely. Unless 
the  opponent decides to send a scout very early they won’t be able to 
scout  you at all. This would be a disadvantage for them because they’d 
be  removing a worker at 6 or 7 supply, effectively putting them behind 
by  almost a minute. So with this opener you just won’t be scouted.</p>
<p><strong>15/19 -&gt;</strong> Right as the Barracks finishes, build one Marine<br>
<strong>17/19 -&gt;</strong> As the 16 SCV finishes (your marine makes 17 supply) upgrade Command Center to Orbital Command (OC)<br>
<strong>17/19 -&gt;</strong> During the upgrade, build one Refinery<br>
<strong>17/19 -&gt;</strong> Supply Depot<br>
<strong>17/19 -&gt;</strong> Put down your second Barracks</p>
<p>Here’s your decision point. From here you can either go heavy 
infantry  or you can push to a factory and go tanks or on to Medivacs. 
It all  depends on your strategy. In a 2v2 I usually suggest a hybrid 
strategy  which is to go heavy infantry with the afterthought of 
immediately  teching to tanks after the first attack. Here’s the 
breakdown on what  you decide.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-901" title="terranguide1" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Standard%20Terran%20Build%20Order%20&amp;%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/terranguide1.png" alt="" height="503" width="660"><strong><span style="color: white;">Heavy Infantry:</span></strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>Heavy Infantry</h2>
<p>After your Orbital Command finishes, immediately continue building 
SCVs  and use your MULE. I usually reserve the scan for the 3rd round of
  energy on my first OC for scanning to figure out what the opponent is 
 going. Also, you should be pumping Marines at this point out of your 
two  Barracks keeping in mind you will be adding add-ons to each of 
them.  After building two SCVs:</p>
<p><strong>19/27 -&gt;</strong> Put down a third Barracks<br>
<strong>21/27 -&gt;</strong> As soon as gas hits 50 add a Tech Lab to the interior (not the walled) Barracks</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-902" title="terranguide2" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Standard%20Terran%20Build%20Order%20&amp;%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/terranguide2.png" alt="" height="503" width="660"></p>
<p>This is where it starts to become up to you to stay on track for your
  build order. Keep pumping SCVs and Marines, and upgrade your second  
Barracks to a Reactor. Start pumping Marauders out of your tech lab  
Barracks once it’s finished. As soon as your third barracks finishes and
  you have 50 gas build a second tech lab onto your third Barracks. This
  both prepares you for an upgrade to tanks and gives you sufficient  
capability to match Marines for Marauders in a 1:3 ratio which is what I
  find to be most effective.</p>
<p>This strategy is a great counter to any tier 1 or 1.5 attack. It 
beats  everything except for Banelings cost effectively. Protoss will 
need to  tech Colossus or have superior micro to beat this combination.</p>
<p>If you would like to proceed to tanks from here simply add a gas at 
SCV  21 and build a factory. Swap out the factory for the Tech Lab 
addons on  your Barracks and produce tanks. Then use your Barracks to 
make either  Tech Labs (against Protoss for sure and against Zerg if 
they’re going  Roach) or Reactors (against Terran).</p>
<p>It is very important to get the Shield upgrade for Marines against  
Terran and Zerg as the added HP makes you more effective against enemy  
Marines, Tanks, and is essential against Mutalisk.</p>
<p>You can do a triple reactor build similar to this against Terran  
opponents as it’s difficult for them to counter mass Marines without  
tanks. If you want to try this rush (it’s only effective if you beat the
  tanks out of the gate and/or they go Marauder) just build one Refinery
  and mine only 150 gas. But you should keep in mind you will need tanks
  if your initial attack fails.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Quick Tank Build:</h2>
<p>This is a quick factory tech build and has another variation that I use against Zerg which I will detail later in this section.</p>
<p>Follow the previous build until 17/19. You will put down your second 
 Barracks and this is where the build strays. You should still use your 
 first and second OC energy pools for MULE.</p>
<p><strong>19/27 -&gt; </strong>Instead of a third Barracks build a second Refinery.<br>
<strong>20/27 -&gt;</strong> As your gas hits 50 use this to create a tech lab at your interior Barracks.<br>
<strong>21/27 -&gt;</strong> Create a tech lab at your walled Barracks<br>
<strong>21/27 -&gt;</strong> Supply Depot</p>
<p>You should still be pumping Marines out of these Barracks when 
they’re  not building their add-ons. Do not build Marauders unless 
necessary.  Conserve the gas for now. Research the Marine shields if you
 feel you  have time but I’d suggest going tanks first as researching 
that will  delay you a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>23/34 -&gt; </strong>Put down your first factory.</p>
<p>You get the idea here. Put down your second factory ASAP and swap out
  your tech labs for the factories. Immediately put down your Barracks 
for  two Reactor addons and start pumping Marines and Tanks as needed.  
Research siege ASAP as well. This build is fantastic against enemy  
Terran players as they rarely adapt their build correctly to TvT. You  
should have the upper hand with your early tanks and can take him down.</p>
<p>It’s very effective to place your tanks near the base of the enemy 
cliff  at the choke, scan the choke, and let your tanks blast away. This
 build  is also great against Protoss. Make sure vs. Protoss that you 
build a  third or fourth Barracks and add a Tech Lab and research Marine
 shields.  Marines make an effective meat shield similar to Vultures in 
SC1. Build  Marauders as needed as well.</p>
<p>Teching up to the Starport and grabbing Medivacs will also benefit 
your  tanks because the tank’s siege range goes beyond its sight lines. 
It  will also give you cliff vision which is essential in tank battles 
and  against Colossus.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Variation of Quick Tank (Hellion Rush):</h2>
<p>So here’s a variation of the tank build. This is effective against  
Protoss and Zerg situationally. It’s the same as the tank build except  
you substitute one tech lab add-on on your Barracks for one Reactor  
add-on. So when you build your two factories and swap them you you’ll  
now have a Factory with a Reactor and a Factory with a Tech Lab. As soon
  as you have this instead of going straight for Siege and Tanks, 
upgrade  the Hellion’s damage. This gives the Hellion an additional +10 
damage  vs. Light units.</p>
<p>While you’re doing this start pumping Hellions. If you’re able to, 
tech  siege tanks as well and build a few of those out of your Tech Lab 
 factory. This should prepare you for any counter attacks.</p>
<p>This strategy is a hard counter for Banelings. Banelings can’t even 
get  near 4 Hellions with damage upgrades and can’t get up a ramp with 
only 2  Hellions at the top when damage is upgraded.</p>
<p>Use these Hellions however you want. Mineral raids are great against 
 Zerg as any Zerg player worth his salt is going for Mutalisks. Any  
harassment you can do with these is going to go a long way toward a  
victory. Hellions aren’t great at taking out the Queen but they will do 
 the job if the opportunity presents itself. But mostly you should go 
for  the workers. With the +10 damage two Hellions will 1-shot a drone. 
This  makes them very effective mineral raiders.</p>
<p>There is some micro involved in correctly using the Hellions for 
mineral  raids. If you have four, place two on either side of the 
Hatchery. This  means when the Zerg player inevitably runs his Drones 
from your  Hellions, they will line up in a straight line on either 
side. If you do  it correctly and the Zerg player does it wrong, the 
Drones will line up  perfectly and you will kill every drone in two 
shots.</p>
<p>Remember, the Hellions are only effective against light units. Focus on the workers and ignore Roaches or Hydralisks. <strong>You can afford to lose your 400 minerals if you kill enough workers.</strong> To make it an effective raid you need to kill at least <strong>5</strong> workers. But you only have a couple tries at this raid, so make it count.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Fortified Expand:</h2>
<p>So let’s say your first attack was reasonably successful but didn’t 
GG  the match right there. You should press your advantage by expanding.</p>
<p>Lots of players think, “Hey, my first attack worked, let’s try it  
again.” I wouldn’t suggest it. Most often the opposing player is aware  
of your strategy now and is preparing against it. They’re also probably 
 on the defensive since your attack (hopefully) did some damage.</p>
<p>Now is the perfect time to switch up your strategy, go economy, and come back at them with an even larger force and better tech.</p>
<p><strong>(NOTE: There is somewhat of an exception against Zerg. You 
really  don’t want them to go Mutalisk if they’re good. Mutas are the 
devil  right now. It’s your choice to press them or not depending on how
  successful your attack was. If you killed his Queen, then go for it!!)</strong></p>
<p>Terran has an advantage when it comes to expanding. Their buildings  
lift, obviously, so you can build your expansion in your base. I always 
 suggest this against Protoss and Zerg. It’s not as big a deal against  
Terran as they’re not as mobile and likely if they find your expansion  
your units will be there to fight them anyway.</p>
<p>But let’s assume you build your expansion in your base. Once your 
start  your new CC, make sure you put down an Engineering Bay if you 
haven’t  already. As soon as that Command Center is completed you should
 lift it  (if you don’t see any major enemy forces headed your way) and 
place it  at the natural. Put it where you think the enemy will come at 
you from  on the ground. Don’t shy away from conflict. This is a 
fortified  expansion. You want them to attack this like the fools they 
are!!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-903" title="terranguide3" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Standard%20Terran%20Build%20Order%20&amp;%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/terranguide3.png" alt="" height="506" width="660"></p>
<p>Once it’s landed build a Planetary Fortress immediately. Send half 
your  SCVs from your main to mine. This is essential as it both boosts 
your  economic output immediately and gives your Planetary Fortress 
triple the  HP because of repair. If your new PF is attacked by anything
 except the  following units, you should immediately start repairing to 
boost its  HP:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than 3 Colossus (or if they have range upgrade)</li>
<li>More than 4 Siege Tanks</li>
<li> Mass Baneling</li>
<li> High Templar</li>
<li> Mass Void Ray</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of the mass Void Ray the only reason I say don’t repair 
is  that it’s a waste of minerals. Unless you think you’re reasonably 
going  to be able to kill the Void Rays before they destroy the outpost,
 don’t  bother. You’re just going to waste 200 minerals on a dying 
structure.</p>
<p>In any case, that’s about it. Put up some turrets if you’d like, 
build  out your refineries, and now you can put pressure on the enemy 
without  being as scared about a counterattack! They’re going to need a 
serious  force to take down that expo down.</p>
<p>That’s about all I have for you except for a couple general tips:</p>
<ul>
<li> If you think your Zerg opponent is going to send Banelings at  your
 choke, put a bunker behind the wider side of the choke and put some  
Marines in it. Sure, you’ll lose your supply depot and the Bunker, but  
they will absorb most of the damage, leaving your Marines and Marauders 
 untouched. This should let you counter whatever is behind/with the  
Banelings.</li>
<li> Be careful with units you have in front of your Siege Tanks. Don’t 
 let them stray too far both for the sake of your tanks and your meat  
shields. You want to protect your tanks from Melee units, and you also  
don’t want to take splash friendly fire damage. If you’re facing mainly 
 Zealots, it’s okay to shell them from a distance, but unsiege once  
they’re close-up.</li>
<li> Don’t get back-doored: Watch any rocks you have in the rear of your
  base. Put a supply depot there to make sure it’s not getting hit.</li>
<li> Use your Planetary Fortress as an anvil. If your opponent is  
foolish enough to hit your PF, make them pay. Bring your main force  
around behind them and trap them between your PF and your main force.  
Press the advantage. If you destroy their main force you have a good  
chance of at least taking out an expansion.</li>
<li> Again, press the advantage. Whenever you beat an attack you need to press.</li>
<li> Again, press! The Terran’s job is to provide a push. If you don’t  
un-turtle at tier 2 then you might as well GG because you can’t concede 
 map control. Push, push, push!</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck out there!</p>

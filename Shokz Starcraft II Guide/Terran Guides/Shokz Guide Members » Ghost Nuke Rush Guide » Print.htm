<p><a href="http://shokzguide.com/members/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/TerranGuide.jpg"></a>Nukes
 in Starcraft 2 are not as powerful as they were in Starcraft. You use 
to be able to take 2 ghosts into an enemies base and wipe out their 
command center, nexus, or hive but not anymore. Instead they made nukes a
 little easier to get, but the main purpose now is to hurt their economy
 by killing their harvesters. While nukes are costly but when used 
effectively can destroy your opponents economy to give you the advantage
 in the game.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Purpose of the Nukes</h2>
<p>Nukes are not single handily going to beat your opponent. When you 
are going for an early nuke attack you need to also keep a steady build 
of units that you can use to defend your base and to attack.The purpose 
of going early nukes is to harass your opponent, take him psychology out
 of his game and it is fun to nuke the hell out of someone.</p>

<p>When using your nukes you don’t want to try to take out his army 
since most players will move there forces once they hear the nuke alarm 
go off and you’ll end up wasting the nuke. Instead you want to go for 
their resources and key buildings. I normally like to have at least 2 
ghosts with nukes so I can keep constant pressure on my opponent.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Building for a Nuke Rush</h2>
<p>They key when building for a quick nuke rush is to also have a good 
size army and unit production going, like I said earlier that you’ll 
still need an army to defend your base and to take your opponents army 
out.&nbsp; While you are preparing your nuke rush go a standard build 
with Marauders into Thors and Tanks or into an air based build so after 
your nuke harassment you can then attack your opponent.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple Academies</strong> -- Once you get your factory up 
start building 2 Ghost Academies. You will want multiple Ghost Academies
 since you can only have 1 nuke per Ghost Academy and by having multiple
 nukes you won’t have to wait to train another nuke once you’ve launched
 one.</p>
<p><strong>Ghost Cloaking</strong> -- Before you even start training 
your first nuke make sure you train the Ghost Cloaking skill first since
 your ghost will easily be killed if she is not cloaked. If you have 
extra resources also train the additional Ghost energy which will allow 
you to stay cloaked for longer.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Attacking with Nukes</h2>
<p><strong>Main Target</strong> -- Your first target should always be 
for your opponents minerals, if you can take out all his workers this 
will give you a big advantage and allow you to continue to macro while 
he has to rebuild all his workers. Make sure when you enter his base you
 keep a look out for anything that can see cloaked units such as 
Overseers, turrets, and Photo Cannons, if you can stay out of sight and 
get into the back of his base with out being seen you should be fine.</p>
<p><strong>Nuking from below</strong> -- On maps where you can get 
behind their minerals from the main path but are on a cliff you won’t be
 able to nuke the area on the cliff unless you have sight. This is where
 you can use your Orbital Command and scan the area and then quickly 
cast a Nuke and once you lose sight from the scan your nuke will already
 be targeted and will still go off.</p>
<h3>Nuke Rush Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nukes are very Gas dependent so expand early</li>
<li>Build multiple Ghost academies so you can have Nukes ready one after another</li>
<li>Once you’ve inflected economic damage, keep the pressure on by attacking with your forces</li>
</ul>

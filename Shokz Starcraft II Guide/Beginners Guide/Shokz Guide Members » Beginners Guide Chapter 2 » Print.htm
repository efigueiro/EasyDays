					<div id="BlogContent"><h1>Chapter 2: Fundamentals</h1>
<p>There are several things which you should be managing at all times   
while playing Starcraft 2. These things are the fundamentals to having  
 good micromanagement (managing/developing the overall game as opposed 
to   controlling individual units), and are the most important step to  
being  a good player in general. To have good fundamentals, a player  
needs the  mental capacity to multitask, and the APM (Actions per  
minute) to  execute the fundamentals, while at the same time formulating
  proper  strategy and executing tactics. This requirement to multitask 
 is one of  the biggest reasons for why SC2 has such an intense skill  
curve, and why  even professionals vary significantly in the mastery of 
 the  fundamentals. Study this chapter carefully, practice daily, and  
soon the  fundamentals will become second nature to you.</p>
<p>There are three basic things that you should always do while playing 
  SC2: Spend your resources, Obtain and control information, and 
maintain   an adequate food supply.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Spend your resources</h2>
<p>Resource investment in Starcraft 2 works within a function of exponential returns, as with any investment in real life.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, investing 100 dollars into Google in September of 2005 
  could give you returns of 250 dollars in 2007, whereas investing 100  
 dollars into Google in September of 2004 would give you a return of 500
   dollars in 2007. Waiting that year meant that year’s potential growth
  in  the investment was lost, so then, in 2007, when you needed the  
returns  back, you only had half as much as you could have had, had you 
 been  quicker to act!</li>
<li>Similarly, the faster you gather your first minerals, the faster you
  can  produce more workers to gather more minerals, and so on. Thus,  
your  efficiency in the early game will have an exponentially greater  
impact  on your strength in the mid game, and even more so in the late  
game. The  extra 500 minerals you had 5 minutes into the game could have
  been 5000  minerals 10 minutes into the game, had you invested it! The
  importance  of constantly spending all of your resources can therefore
  not be  overstated.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it is extremely important that you  invest your resources  
appropriately. There are three basic categories  in which you can spend 
 your resources: Economy, Army, and Technology.  You will typically want
  to split your investment in all 3. However,  knowing which one to 
invest  in at any given time is crucial to having  strong fundamentals.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>Investing in Economy will give you more resources to spend later in  
the  game. You can invest in economy by building more probes(workers) or
  by  expanding. During a typical game of SC2, you should almost always 
 be  producing probes.</p>
<h3>Worker Production</h3>
<p>Once you have a certain number of probes gathering from a single  
mineral  patch or assimilator, you stop gaining any benefit by assigning
  more  probes to gather from that node. In most cases, this occurs when
  you  have 3 probes per mineral patch or assimilator. This is called  
being  “fully saturated.” You typically will want 3 probes in each  
assimilator,  from the moment the assimilator finishes until it runs  
dry. You want as  many probes as possible mining from your minerals, but
  when you start  getting more than 3 per patch, it’s time to transfer  
some to a new  expansion.</p>
<p>Why? The more probes you have gathering minerals or gas, the more   
saturated your mineral line or assimilators. However, there is a   
diminishing return in probe investment, while saturating your mineral   
line. This is because workers spend a certain amount of time gathering  
 from a mineral field or assimilator, and a certain amount of travel 
time   going to and from your nexus. As the number of workers per 
mineral   patch or assimilator increases, the time that those workers, 
as a   collective, can spend gathering increases, as additional workers 
can   gather while the others travel. Because of the distance between a 
  properly placed nexus and a mineral field, the travel time is short, 
and   having three probes is enough to ensure constant gathering from 
that   node 100% of the time This is called being “fully saturated”. 
It’s   usually a bad idea to have more than 3 probes gathering from a 
single   assimilator. You should also generally never have more than 3 
probes per   mineral patch (this is called “super saturation”), but 
there is one   exception (intent to maynard).</p>
<p>Adding additional probes to gather from a mineral field increases  
your  income by a constant amount per probe until you have 2 probes per 
  mineral field, and then by a decreased amount until you have 3 probes 
  per mineral field. After that, you get no additional benefit from 
adding   more probes.</p>
<h3>Expanding</h3>
<p>Expanding is building a new nexus by a mineral line and/or vespene   
geysers. This area is called an “expansion”. In almost every map of SC2,
   there is an expansion very close to the starting location (or main) 
of   each player. This intuitive expansion location is called the  
“natural”.  The natural will be the typical first place to expand to in 
 any given  game.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s important to remember that the cost of expanding is not only  
the  minerals for the new nexus, but also for the probes you will need  
to  gather at the new expansion. When expanding, remember that it’s  
always  best for both bases to be equally saturated. However, remember  
that the  two vespene geysers will require an extra 6 probes for full  
saturation.  With this in mind, when you get a new expansion going, you 
 should do one  of two things:</li>
<li>if you have more than 2 probes per mineral patch at your existing  
bases,  you should divide your probes evenly amongst all of your bases, 
 such  that the ratio of probes per mineral field at every base is 
equal.  This  is called maynarding: transferring workers from a 
saturated  mineral line  to an unsaturated mineral line, to quickly 
equalize  saturation and  greatly increase efficiency (by reducing the  
aforementioned diminishing  returns).</li>
<li>if you have 2 or less probes per mineral patch at your existing  
bases,  you can simply produce probes at your new expansion without  
needing to  shift them between bases and still mine optimally. It’s  
generally easier  to just divide them evenly (maynard them) anyway, as  
that allows you to  use every nexus to produce probes simultaneously and
  still receive  optimal benefit.</li>
</ul>
<p>whenever you mine out an expansion, it’s a good idea to evenly split 
 the  idle probes between your existing bases in a similar fashion.   
Alternately, if a new expansion is just going online, you can forgo the 
  usual transfer and simply send all of the ones from your mined-out 
base   instead for instant saturation.</p>
<p>During a typical game of SC2, you should almost always be producing  
 probes. The exception to this is when you have to devote every mineral 
  to your army; or for teching more quickly, with a specific build order
   in mind (more on this in chapter 3). Please do remember, though, that
   this only applies when you are trying to achieve a specific goal; if 
you   do not have a specific planned use for the additional minerals, 
always   produce probes.</p>
<p>You should typically seek to expand when you have either put yourself
   at an army advantage (by killing significantly more of his combat  
units  than you’ve lost), or when your current mineral lines are  
approaching  full saturation. Expanding is a big investment, and will  
always reduce  the potential size of your army in the short run. The  
earlier you  expand, the bigger the relative investment.</p>
<p>Try to always produce probes and often consider expanding, to remain economically competitive with your opponent.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t forget to build your economy, even while battles are taking place!</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>Army</h2>
<p>Another way you can spend your resources is by building combat units,
   like zealots and stalkers. Army production is limited by the amount 
of   resources you have, and production cycles. For example, it takes 42
  game  seconds to produce a stalker from a gateway. This means that you
  can  produce one stalker every 42 seconds with a single gateway. If 
you  build  another gateway, then you can build 2 stalkers every 42  
seconds(one  production cycle), or one stalker every 21 seconds on  
average. The more  production buildings you have, the more units you can
  produce per cycle,  the more quickly you can build an army. You should
  try at all times to  spend all of your resources left over after  
building probes and teching  on combat units. If you find yourself with a
  lot of minerals or gas left  over after using all of your production  
(this is called floating), make  some more unit producing buildings to  
spend it! Have a contest with  yourself to see how close to 0 you can  
keep your minerals and gas all  game, while still expanding and making  
probes!</p>
<p>Seek to have a balance between your income and the number of unit   
producing buildings you have. If you have too many, you will not have   
the income to produce a unit every production cycle, and thereby lose   
efficiency. If you have too few, you will not be able to produce units  
 quickly enough to use the resources you are accumulating.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, stalkers cost 125 minerals and 50 gas. With 2 gateways,
  you  can make one stalker every 21 seconds — or about 3 every minute  
on  average. Therefore, if you have an income of 375 minerals and 150  
gas  per minute, then you can produce stalkers out of 2 gateways  
nonstop.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to always maintain an army which is comparative to or
   greater in strength than your enemy’s. If you invest too heavily into
   economy or technology, and your enemy scouts your vastly inferior 
army,   he may decide to attack immediately and eliminate you.</p>
<p>Even if you have more production buildings and resources than  your  
enemy, he can still out produce you if he more consistently uses  his  
production buildings every single cycle. Make sure that you use as  much
  of your production as possible whenever you can, unless you’re  
certain  that no units you can make from that building would be helpful 
 at all.</p>
<ul>
<li>The correct units to build and include in your army will depend upon
   what units your enemy is building, and what tech is available to you.
   Both of these things are other parts of the fundamentals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Don’t forget to build your army, even while battles are taking place!</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>The last way to invest your resources is in technology, or tech. Tech
  is  what allows you to build new buildings and units, to access new   
abilities for your spell casting units, and to research upgrades for   
your units. Investing in tech is as important as in economy or army,   
because without the right tech, your army will likely be largely   
ineffective!</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, before you can build units which can attack flying   
units (air), you must build a cybernetics core. If all you have are   
zealots, you will have no way of defeating an air army.</li>
<li>Tech is limited by resources and time, required to build the tech structure, or research the ability or upgrade.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to tech quickly enough to be able to appropriately  
deal  with anything your opponent throws at you. Knowing what to tech  
to, and  how quickly, will depend upon scouting. You have to know what  
your  opponent is doing before you can counter him. It is also important
  to  know whether your opponent will be able to counter your tech 
before  you  ever get it.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, Dark Templar require the Dark Shrine before they can be
   constructed. Dark Templar rely largely upon their permanent   
invisibility. If your enemy already has detectors (allowing him to see  
 your Dark Templar) then the Dark Templar will be largely ineffective 
and   a Dark Shrine may be a poor investment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Investing too much into tech too quickly can, of course, hurt your   
economy or army. However, you should always steadily tech throughout a  
 game, as it opens many more strategic and tactical options for you.   
We’ll talk more about this later on. For now, though, remember to stick 
  around at each level of tech for a short time while making units 
before   moving on to the next one in order to keep yourself from being 
  overwhelmed.</p>
<p><strong> Don’t forget to advance your tech, even while battles are taking place!</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>Obtain and Control information</h2>
<p>We’ve just gone over the ways you can spend your resources, but   
knowing what is the appropriate investment at any given time depends   
largely on your collection and control of information in the game, which
   includes hiding information from your opponent. Information is  
obtained  by scouting, and information is hidden by denying scouting.  
There are  multiple ways to do both, and are all limited chiefly by your
  APM.</p>
<p>Information in SC2 can be simplified to two main subjects: What you  
 are spending your resources on, and where your army is located.</p>
<p>What you are spending your resources on is very important to your enemy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you expanding? This will mean that your army will suffer, so now might be a good time to attack you.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What way are you teching? Knowing how you tech tells your enemy what
   you are capable of doing, and lets him know exactly what he should do
   to respond. As in the previous example, if he scouts your dark 
shrine,   then he knows to be prepared for dark templar.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What kind of army are you building? Knowing how you tech, and   
knowing how you use it in your army are two different things. Seeing   
exactly what kind of army composition you have assembled will allow your
   enemy to more appropriately build a counter force.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Also keep in mind that “gas doesn’t lie”. For example, if he has   
both of his geysers before mid game, then he has a reason. If he doesn’t
   have both geysers, you can be pretty confident he isn’t building air,
   or any high gas tech, etc. Just keep in mind that the amount of gas  
he’s  taking in determines what he can build as much as anything, so  
keep an  eye on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The location of your army is equally important to your enemy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is your army heading toward his base? If he scouts this, he knows he should prepare for an attack.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Is your army far from one of your expansions? He may find an   
opportunity to attack your expansion before you have a chance to defend 
  it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing the location of your army will tell him where to position his army in general.</p>
<h3>So how do you scout? There are many ways</h3>
<p>The earliest scouting method in most SC2 games is sending a worker   
straight into the enemy’s base before he has any defenses, to see how he
   is teching in the early game. This allows you to check for any early 
  aggression that he might have in store for you, so you can quickly 
build   an army to defend against it (a good example of when you might 
want to   not build probes or tech). Depending on how long you keep your
 worker   alive, you may also see what kind of mid game tech he has in 
mind as   well. Sending a probe to the enemy base in the mid game and 
later can   also be a useful scout. The probe will likely die before 
ever setting   foot inside the base, but it will see exactly what kind 
of army killed   it, which is information you need. You can also send a 
probe to various   expansions around the map, to check if your enemy has
 expanded to them.</p>
<p>Protoss observers are very powerful scouts, as they are permanently  
 invisible and thus naturally discreet. They’re also flying units, so it
   easy to get them into your enemy’s base.</p>
<p>Any flying unit is a possible scout, because it can possibly  
circumvent  any ground forces that would otherwise physically block an  
attempted  scout.</p>
<p>Moving your actual army up to your enemy’s base to “poke” at him will
   often reveal important information, such as his army composition and 
  defenses, allowing you to determine whether you are ready to actually 
  assault his base or not.</p>
<p>There are other creative ways to scout as well. For example, the  
Protoss  sentry has the hallucination ability, which allows you to  
create a  phantom protoss unit of your choosing. Experienced players  
will often  use this ability to create a quick  flying unit (the  
phoenix) to fly  through the enemy base, without the risk of losing any 
 real units.</p>
<h3>How to deny scouting or fool your foe</h3>
<p>Denying an enemy from scouting you can be just as important, or more 
  important than scouting him. Certain strategies rely on surprise more 
  than others.</p>
<p>Hide tech buildings. You can hide tech buildings in back corners of  
your  main, or even proxy tech buildings some place hidden on the map.  
 Proxying tech is an extremely effective way of hiding it from the 
enemy,   but also risky, as it puts the building far from the protection
 of  your  base.</p>
<p>Kill would-be scouts before they have a chance to gain the  
information  they want. If you’re teching in a new direction, don’t let 
 your enemy  get into your base to find out. If you are playing against 
 Zerg, kill  his overlords if they try to fly into your main, before 
they  get a  chance to spot your new tech.</p>
<p>Build the tech or production building just after the enemy scout has 
  left your main.  One of the most deceptive methods of information   
control is to make the enemy think he knows what’s coming, and use it   
against him. This will fool him into believing he doesn’t have to worry 
  about whatever it is you are about to do, at least for a few minutes  
 until he tries to scout again.</p>
<p>Do the above after canceling a building in construction. If your  
enemy  sees you constructing a certain tech or production structure, he 
 will be  rather certain that you are going to use it. After you get his
  scout  out of your base, you can cancel the structure and build  
something  entirely different.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to scout, even while battles are taking place!</p>
<h3>Maintain an adequate food supply</h3>
<p>This final part of the fundamentals is certainly the simplest, but   
just as important. In order to spend your resources (building probes and
   army), you must have the food supply available to do it, and often   
times even scouting will depend upon having the food available to build 
  the necessary unit immediately.<br>
Supply can mean the difference between easily defending against an attack, and losing horribly.</p>
<p>The key to maintaining an adequate food supply is knowing how much   
food you are using each production cycle, and building an appropriate   
number of pylons every time you go back to build more units.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, if I’m building zealots, stalkers, and sentries out of 4
   gateways, I need to build a new pylon every single production cycle, 
  because each of those units requires 2 supply, and a pylon gives only 8
   supply. But I have to keep in mind that I’m also producing probes,   
meaning I actually need more than one pylon every single production   
cycle.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Glancing back to check your supply very often is a good habit to avoid becoming supply blocked. This simply takes practice.</li>
</ul>

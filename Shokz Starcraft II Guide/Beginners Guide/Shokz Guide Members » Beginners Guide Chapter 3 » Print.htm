					<div id="BlogContent"><h1>Chapter 3: Micromanagement</h1>
<p>Micromanagement is the management of individual units, as opposed to 
 developing your overall game. Although macromanagement is more 
important  in a basic sense, a player slightly worse macro and slightly 
better  micro can certainly win a game. Micromanagement will prove the  
efficiency and effectiveness of your army. If you lose half the resource
  value of units in each battle compared to your opponent, you can have 
 an income almost half of his and still come out even. If you micro  
when going for a base assault, your attack can easily be defeated with  
heavy losses.</p>
<p>There are three main ways to micro: Positioning, Focus fire, and Spell Casting.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Positioning</h2>
<p>Positioning is, by far, the most important part of  micro. It also 
has extreme depth, and so it will have a guide of its  own. In this 
guide, I’ll just lay down the basics so you have a general  idea of what
 to do.</p>
<p>Keep your shorter ranged units in front of your longer ranged units. 
For  example, always keep your zealots in front of your stalkers, before
  engaging in battle. Otherwise, your zealots will be blocked from  
attacking by the stalkers themselves.</p>
<p>Keep your tougher, cheaper units in front. Again, another good 
example  is to keep your zealots in front of your stalkers. Zerglings 
kill  stalkers extremely quickly, but if there is a line of zealots 
between  the zerglings and your stalkers, your survivability increases  
dramatically.</p>
<p>Use bottle necks to your advantage. If your army has more ranged 
units  than your enemy’s army, then forcing the enemy to fight you in a 
 bottleneck will reduce his DPS (damage per second), and give you an  
advantage.</p>
<p>Keep your army where you need it. This goes back to the scouting  
fundamental. Keep an eye on your enemy’s army, and keep your army in a  
position to defend against his. No matter how much stronger your army  
is, it won’t do any good if it’s completely out of position while he  
destroys your base.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Kiting and Reverse Kiting</h2>
<p>Move your army closer to the enemy if part of it is out of range. For
  example, say you have a lot of stalkers. If you simply attack-move  
(pressing “a” and then left clicking in a direction) an enemy army, the 
 front line of your stalkers will attack from max range, while the  
stalkers behind them will be out of range and do nothing useful. You can
  fix this by attack-moving, waiting until the front line fires its 
first  shots, and then right clicking to move forward, and then quickly 
 attack-move again. Repeat this process until your units are close 
enough  for every single one of them to fire. If you do this correctly, 
the  units should fire as quickly as if they were standing still, but 
move in  between shots. This technique is called “scoot and shoot”, 
because  that’s what it is. You can do this toward the enemy as 
described above,  or to move away from an enemy, which is also called 
“kiting”.</p>
<p>Kiting is extremely important, because it can increase the 
survivability  of a unit by an extremely large amount. A good example is
 a stalker  fighting a zealot. If a zealot and stalker stand still and 
attack each  other, the zealot will win the fight. However, if a stalker
 kites the  zealot, the stalker can kill the zealot without taking a 
single hit,  because stalkers are faster than zealots and have a much 
longer range.</p>
<h3>Focus Firing</h3>
<p>Focus fire is directing all of your units to attack specific enemies,
  instead of finding targets on their own. So, instead of fairly evenly 
 damaging an entire army slowly over time, you can direct your army to  
attack a single enemy at a time. This can give you a huge advantage in a
  fight.</p>
<p>For example, say 10 stalkers fight against 10 stalkers. If no focus 
fire  occurs, both armies should destroy each other evenly. However, if 
one  army is micro’d to focus fire specific enemies one at a time, then 
the  enemy will lose DPS much faster, meaning the micro’d army will take
 much  less damage by the end of the fight. Imagine if the 10 stalkers 
for the  micro’d army are all at 50% hp, whereas in the other army, 50% 
of the  stalkers are now dead. The micro’d army would have twice as much
 DPS and  just as much hp remaining, putting it at a huge advantage.</p>
<p>Focus fire is important in all battles. Good targets for focus fire 
are  units which deal abnormally high damage, or which can cast powerful
  spells. Other targets might be detectors, allowing your cloaked units 
 (such as dark templar) to freely destroy the enemy army.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Spell Casting</h2>
<p>Spell casting is the use of special abilities that  certain units 
possess. Each spell caster unit has a different ability  from any other,
 so the proper use of any given spell depends on  knowledge and 
experience of that unit. Using spells effectively,  however, requires 
that you keep the caster in range of its target, as  opposed to being 
blocked off out of range by your own army, or picked  off and killed by 
the enemy.</p>
<p>Pay careful attention to the positioning of your spell caster, and 
his  energy (which is required to cast spells), or you’ll find, at the 
end of  the battle, that your investment in the unit was a waste.</p>

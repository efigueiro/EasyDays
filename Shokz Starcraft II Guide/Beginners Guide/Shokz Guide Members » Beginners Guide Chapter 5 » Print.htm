					<div id="BlogContent"><h1>Chapter 5: Meta Game</h1>
<h2>Knowing your enemy</h2>
<p>SC2 is largely dictated by metagame, perhaps more so than the typical
  player realizes. Metagame is the game outside of the game. For 
example,  if you are a Protoss player, and have just watched a Protoss 
player  attempt an early double gateway zealot aggression build 4 games 
in a row  against other Protoss players, and then face against him, what
 would  you do? You would probably prepare for his aggression before you
 even  get the slightest in-game hint that he had that in store for you,
 just  because you know that he, as a person in real life, prefers that 
 strategy. Taking that a level up, he might know that you expect it, and
  do a completely different strategy, using metagame knowledge against  
you.</p>
<p>Metagame can determine how a match begins to how it ends, and can  
vary from region to region. For example, in the US, the most common  
timings and strategies that any given Terran player uses might differ  
substantially from the timings and strategies of the average Terran in  
Korea. This can lead the players who go against Terrans in the US and  
Korea to also create timings and strategies that differ from one  
another. Players naturally base strategies somewhat on what they expect 
 the enemy to do, regardless of whether they scout it or not. This can  
make things more efficient for you, but also riskier.</p>
<p>There is not much to guide you in metagame, as there isn’t a whole  
lot you can do to fool someone with it, beyond the above examples. It’s 
 just important to keep in mind that a unit or strategy may be more or  
less powerful simply due to how the enemy player uses entirely different
  units or strategies.</p>

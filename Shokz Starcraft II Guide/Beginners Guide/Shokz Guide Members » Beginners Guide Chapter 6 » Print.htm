					<div id="BlogContent"><h1>Knowing yourself</h1>
<p>This chapter gets a lot more personal than the previous chapters, as a lot of it goes back to personal experience.</p>
<p>Now,  I know it’s pretty cliché to say that you need to know 
yourself,  but  in gaming and any competitive profession, it’s more true
 than some   might like to admit. There are two archetypal goals in 
which you need to   change the way you play or even think, in order to 
get results. Those   two things are Self Improvement and Competitive 
Success. There is a big   difference between playing to improve, and 
playing to win. If you want   to become successful, you need to know how
 to improve yourself most   efficiently, and you need to know how to get
 the right mindset to win.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Self Improvement</h2>
<p>Self improvement is not playing to win, and you should expect to lose
   a lot. Losing is fine, and you have no reason to be upset or 
embarrassed  by a loss. Frustration is understandable, but just remember
  that you  aren’t playing games to prove anything, and you aren’t 
playing  to win.  You are playing to improve, so you can play to win 
later, when  it  matters.</p>
<p>If you lose a game, take a break, maybe get a  drink, and let your  
mind settle on something else, then come back and  watch the replay. 
Find  out exactly what happened. Don’t just look for  the big obvious 
reason  that you lost (if there is one), look for other  more subtle 
things you  could have improved upon to, perhaps things that  directly 
lead to your  defeat, or not. It’s important, though, to not  feel 
emotional or biased  when watching the replay. It’s also important  to 
look at things you  weren’t looking at when you played the game.  Don’t 
watch the battles if  you already know how they go down, or if you  
already know your micro is  fine. Watch your production facilities. Did 
 your macro slip? If you got  hit by a surprise strategy, look at all  
the times you could have  scouted, and try to next time.</p>
<p>How to  improve yourself most efficiently is a subject not covered by
  almost  any guides on SC2, or gaming in general, but is essentially 
the  most  important topic of all. Everyone learns in different ways, 
but  there  are some very important facts about the physiological way 
humans  learn  that you should know.</p>
<p>Grinding out games is likely not an  efficient method for you to 
learn  the game. Learning proper macro and  micro is a system that your 
brain  has to learn to adjust to. Excepting  specific build orders 
(which vast  repetition helps to perfect),  grinding out huge amounts of
 games as fast  as possible will likely make  it harder for you to learn
 to play.</p>
<p>Starcraft 2 is an extremely  complex game, and there is a lot of  
information to pick up on. You have  to give your brain time to “chew 
on”  all of the information it’s  taking in. This could mean a few 
seconds,  or minutes of break after  each game. It will also almost 
certainly mean  that after every several  games, you should take a 
significant break (an  hour or so, depending  person to person), or even
 stop for the day.</p>
<ul>
<li>Personally, I have always been a grinder as far as learning a new   
activity. When I learned to play any game in the past, such as WoW, and 
  when I learned to play guitar, I did it by spending many hours each  
day  playing. This wasn’t by design; I just enjoyed playing.</li>
<li>However, when it came to SC2, my goal was to become as good as I   
could as efficiently as I could. What resulted was a lack of motivation 
  to play large numbers of games, and instead focusing significant  
amounts  of brain power to thinking about SC2 all day long, every day,  
even  while not doing anything related to it.  I’m sure you know what  
it’s  like, where a subject “feels” relevant just after doing the  
activity.  Not specific thoughts, just a lingering feeling, all day  
long.</li>
<li>If you can maintain this feeling, your mind will adjust to the  
system  of macro and micro within SC2. However, practice is always vital
  to  self improvement. The key is moderation. “Don’t bite off more than
  you  can chew”, or in this case, “Don’t bite off more than your mind 
can   process”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another extremely important key to improvement is very similar to the
   above, and it’s sleep. Sleep is what allows humans to write temporary
   “on the top of your head” thoughts into permanence, which is where 
you   want it. I wouldn’t advise forcing yourself to sleep when you 
aren’t   tired, but I would advise going to sleep when you are.</p>
<p>These  things may seem a bit abstract and unrelated to the actual 
game,  but  these are real physiological mechanics to learning a new 
activity.   Learn how your brain works and you can learn SC2 twice as 
quickly and   efficiently as the next person.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Playing to Win</h2>
<p>Playing to win is simple in concept: Do everything you can to 
maximize  your chances of victory. Give yourself no arbitrary metagame 
rules.  Nothing is “cheesy” if it makes you win. If you think it will 
lead to  your victory, then do it. There’s more to it than that though.</p>
<p>Play with the right mindset. Your mental state is extremely important to your success.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t invest your emotions in the outcome of the game.</li>
<li>Don’t expect to win.</li>
<li> To play at your best, you have to give up the intent or confidence 
 to win. You must invest all of that intent and confidence in making the
  right decisions and playing well. You’re playing to win, not playing 
to  want to win. Victory is an abstract concept which is achieved 
through a  combination of many other smaller goals. Intend to achieve 
those goals,  and you will achieve victory as well.</li>
<li>You shouldn’t feel happy that you’ve won a game; you should instead 
feel  happy that you played well enough to succeed. The same way, you  
shouldn’t get upset if you lose either, and instead analyze,  
objectively, the cause (which goes back to the improvement section).</li>
<li>Don’t feel confident or unconfident about beating any given player. I
  don’t care if you’re going against the “best player” in the world. 
Don’t  let it bother you, because if you win, now you’re the best player
 in  the world. All that matters is that you play well, not you or your 
 opponent’s history.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>How to take a frustrating loss</strong></h3>
<p>1.) Breath and cool down.</p>
<p>2.) Take a look at the replay and see what you could of done to improve your game and possibly win.</p>
<p>We all know what it’s like to play well, feel like you did everything
  right, and then lose in the end anyway, after a long game. It’s  
frustrating. However, you always lose for a good reason. Always remember
  that there is enough room to improve that no matter how you lost, 
there  was a way you could have avoided it. So, when you are frustrated 
and  have lost, just breathe and do nothing. Don’t say something you 
will  regret. Just don’t act at all until you have calmed down. For some
  people, this happens in a fraction of a second, and for many, it can  
take minutes or longer to get over the frustration. Personally, years of
  forcing myself to think logically instead of emotionally has  
conditioned me to get over the frustration before I physically have a  
chance to speak. What it hasn’t done, however, is remove the emotion. No
  matter who you are, the emotional effect of frustration will linger 
for  some time and will always hurt your performance. This is an 
extremely  important concept to accept if you want to win.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t play while frustrated.</strong> Take a break for as  
long as you need, or for as long as possible, before playing the next  
game. You might be in a tournament, but they will give you a 5 minute  
break (or longer) between two games, and you should take it. You might  
just be playing the ladder, and there’s always the urge to queue again  
instantly and try to avenge yourself for the loss. Don’t give into this 
 urge. The importance of this can not be overstated, as frustration  
almost always leads to unnecessary losses and more frustration.</p>
<h3><strong>How to take an exciting win</strong></h3>
<p>This can be significantly harder than taking a frustrating loss. There are two steps.</p>
<p>1) Breathe.</p>
<p>2) Throw a party! Just joking, If it was a tough fought out game you 
can still look at replays and see what you did good and what you could 
of done to make the game easier.</p>
<p>Again, there is always a reason your opponent lost, and you always  
have room enough to improve significantly. Don’t say or do anything for 
 at least a few moments, as again, the excitement of an important 
victory  can affect even the most disciplined of minds into taking less 
than  optimal actions.</p>
<p>This is much less obvious than with a frustrating loss, but playing  
immediately after an exciting victory is not a great idea. Give it at  
least a minute’s break, so you can gather your thoughts again, and start
  thinking wholly objectively again, instead of thinking about how well 
 you just played. You need to play well in the next game too, and even  
positive emotions will throw you off your game.<br>
Have fun. As with any activity, you have to be self motivated to improve and to succeed, otherwise it simply will not happen.</p>

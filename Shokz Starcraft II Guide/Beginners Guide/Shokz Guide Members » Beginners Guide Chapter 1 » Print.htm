<p>Whether you’re new to the RTS genre, or already a strong player, read
  this guide and you’ll gain either the basic knowledge of the game, or 
 advanced concepts you need to get on your way toward success in  
Starcraft 2 (SC2).</p>
<p>“RTS” stands for “real-time strategy”. In Starcraft 2, you have to  
make decisions and actions in real time against an opponent who is doing
  the same. This is opposed to turn-based strategy games (TBS), which 
are  played one move at a time in turn. Playing against live players 
online  in real time can be quite stressful and is a rigorous test of 
each  player’s speed, skill, smarts, and endurance.</p>
<p>Before I go on, I would like to say that you will not get more out of
  these guides than you put into them. A speedy perusal will net a small
  increase in your Starcraft games; similarly, an in-depth study 
followed  by careful practice will yield much more substantial results. 
Knowing  what to do isn’t the same as actually executing it, and when it
 comes to  Starcraft, execution can be extremely difficult and take 
quite a bit of  practice.</p>
<p>We’re going to assume you play the Protoss race for the duration of  
this guide for simplicity’s sake. If you would like to play a different 
 race from the get-go, much of what is listed in this guide will still  
apply, but please bear in mind that some examples are written  
specifically from the perspective of a Protoss player. It’ll be a little
  like transposing a song to a different key: the relationships will be 
 the same, but the individual notes will have different names.</p>
<p>Each of the following chapters hold extremely important knowledge to a
  player of any skill level. Although the chapters are written with the 
 assumption that the reader has no knowledge of the game, some concepts 
 discussed may be sophisticated. If the explanations to any given advice
  is too much to take in, just<br>
remember the advice itself, and worry about  the “why” later.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Chapter 1: Basic Game Concepts</h1>
<p>There are three races in Starcraft 2. They are the Protoss, Terrans, 
 and Zerg. Each race has its own unique buildings and units, each with  
their own names. However, there are sure similarities between the races,
  and the concepts learned in this guide will apply to all three. For  
example, the worker for Protoss, Terran, and Zerg are “probe”, “SCV”,  
and “drone” respectively, while their roles are almost identical.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Units and Buildings</h2>
<p>The goal of Starcraft is to eliminate all of your opponent’s  
buildings. There are two kinds of things that you can build and control 
 in Starcraft: buildings, and units.</p>
<h3>Units</h3>
<p>Units are things like marines or siege tanks – they’re men or  
vehicles that you can use to defeat your opponent. You can order them to
  move around the map or do other things. Most units can attack things 
to  eventually destroy them. Some units have special abilities that do  
special things, like prevent other units from moving, or take control of
  them temporarily. There are three very special units, called workers, 
 one for each race, that can collect resources and spend them in order 
to  construct buildings.</p>
<h3>Buildings</h3>
<p>Buildings are for the most part largely immobile, big things that  
you can use to construct units at the cost of resources, research  
upgrades at the cost of resources, or unlock the ability to construct  
additional kinds of units or buildings (we call this moving down the  
tech-tree). Each kind of building differs in how it specifically  
fulfills these roles: a gateway, for example, can construct zealots,  
stalkers, sentries, high templar, and dark templar, and it also unlocks 
 the ability to construct cybernetics cores. A forge, on the other hand,
  does not produce any units at all, but enables you to build photon  
cannons, which are stationary defensive buildings. Forges can also be  
used to research upgrades that make all of your ground units stronger.</p>
<p>Buildings are also called structures. We’ll try not to confuse you  
too much over the course of our guides by rapidly switching back and  
forth, but do be aware that both words mean the same thing.</p>
<p>A “proxy” is a structure built outside of one’s base, either  
somewhere hidden on the map, or built near or even inside of an enemy’s 
 base. This is a bit advanced, don’t worry about it for now, but keep it
  in mind for later chapters.</p>
<p>Both buildings and units have a value called ‘hit points’ assigned to
  them. Whenever a unit or building attacks another unit or building, it
  takes away some of that unit or building’s hit points. When a unit or 
 building runs out of hit points, it dies and is removed from the game.</p>
<p>Most buildings cannot attack. Some exceptions: photon cannons, spine 
 crawlers, spore crawlers, missile turrets, and planetary fortresses.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>In order to build new units or buildings, we need to have resources 
to  spend. There are three kinds of resources, each of which is acquired
 in  different ways.</p>
<h3>Minerals</h3>
<p>Minerals are the most basic resources. You get minerals by telling  
your probes (Protoss workers) to mine from mineral patches by  
right-clicking on them with the worker selected. The worker will gather 
 several minerals and then return them to your nearest nexus, then it  
will go back to the mineral field and mine some more, repeating the  
process. All buildings, units, and upgrades require some amount of  
minerals, so make sure you always have workers mining! The group of  
mineral patches at an expansion is called the “mineral line”.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1003" title="StarcraftMinerals" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Beginners%20Guide%20Chapter%201%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/StarcraftMinerals.jpg" alt="" height="187" width="660"></p>
<h3>Vespene Gas</h3>
<p>Vespene gas is the second resource. Gas is used in upgrades as well  
as in advanced units and buildings.  The more powerful and exotic an  
individual unit is, the more gas it takes. Advanced air units like  
carriers and spellcasters like high templar take a lot of gas to make.  
You get gas by building an assimilator on a vespene geyser. Once it’s  
built, you can order workers to harvest from it the same as with  
minerals: by right clicking. The workers will again move back and forth 
 between the resource node (in this case the assimilator) and your 
nexus,  harvesting on each journey. Think of vespene like oil, and think
 of  assimilators like an oil derrick – it allows you to get at the 
resources  that would otherwise be hard to reach. Your workers still 
have to  collect the little gas packets, though, so make sure you don’t 
forget!</p>
<h3>Supply</h3>
<p>Food is the third resource, and it works slightly differently than  
the other two. You only need food in order to produce more units, but  
all units take some amount of food. In order to get more food, you need 
 to build pylons, which give 8 food supply each. Nexuses also give food 
 supply, but you shouldn’t build them for that alone. Think of it as a  
nice perk instead.</p>
<p>Food is, in the game, called “psi” (For Protoss), “supply” (For 
Terran),  or “control” (For Zerg). These three names are simplified by 
most  players to “Food”, because the resource functions the same way for
 all  three races. We’ll try not to use those too much, but do be aware 
that  the other names exist.</p>
<p>Food behaves a little differently than minerals or gas. Instead of  
subtracting the build cost of a unit from your food stockpile, the food 
 that a unit takes to build is added to your current food count. You  
cannot build more units if those units would cause your current food  
count to exceed your maximum food supply. When your units die, though,  
they are removed from your current food count, freeing up the ability to
  construct additional units to replace them.</p>
<p>Food is displayed as current food count, followed by a slash, 
followed  by your current maximum food supply in the upper right hand 
corner of  your screen.</p>
<p>Let’s go through an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have 6 probes.  Probes count as 1 food each, so my current food count is 6.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I have one Nexus. Nexuses give 10 food supply each, so my maximum food supply is 10.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This is expressed in the corner of my screen as 6/10.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If I build a zealot, which takes 2 food, my current food would go up
  to 8. My total food supply would not change, bringing me to 8/10.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If I build another zealot which takes 2 food, my current food would 
 go up to 10. My total food would still be the same, bringing me to  
10/10. I now cannot build new units, since that would place my current  
food over my maximum food.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If I were to lose a probe, which takes 1 food, my current food would
  go down to 9. Now, I can build another probe to replace it, since that
  would take me to 10/10, but I can’t build another zealot, since that  
would place my current food over my maximum food.</li>
</ul>
<p>When your pylons die, you lose the food supply that they were giving 
 you. You’ll need to reconstruct them in order to continue producing  
units.</p>
<p>When you don’t have enough food supply to build any more units, you’re “supply blocked”.</p>
<p>There are three other resources that we’ll talk about in later 
guides:  APM, Production Cycles, and Time. These are all  significantly 
more  abstract and complex, though, so don’t worry about them for now.</p>
<p>So how do we win at Starcraft? We use our workers to collect 
resources  and build buildings, and use those buildings to construct 
units to  destroy our opponent’s buildings. Of course, our opponent is 
going to be  trying to do the same thing – and that’s where it gets 
interesting!</p>

<p>If you’ve got the fundamentals to macro and decent micro, you should 
be  well on your way toward being a decent player. However, even the 
best  macro or micro player will still lose if he doesn’t have a logical
 build  order, good timings, and polish.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Build Order</h2>
<p>A build order<strong> </strong>is the order in  which you construct 
your buildings, units, or research upgrades. Build  orders are often 
numbered by the supply count at which something is  built, but can also 
simply be based in chronological order. For example,  a “10 gate” is a 
gateway made when you have 10 probes. This could be  followed up with a 
cybernetics core “immediately afterward”, meaning as  soon as the 
gateway is completed, but at no particular supply count.</p>
<p>Build orders are designed to give you utmost efficiency and  
effectiveness in your strategy. If you plan for early aggression, when  
is the best time to build your first gateways? When should you attack?  
When do you transition out of this early build? The only way to know is 
 with experience and theorycraft. You need to know when your enemy will 
 be ready for you, and when he won’t be. This will take scouting and the
  experience to extrapolate information from what little you’ll be able 
to  see. You’ll have to theorize when and where he’ll do what, and form 
 your build around it.</p>
<p>For example, if you scout a Zerg player Fast Expanding (FE, expanding
  very early in the game, often before any combat units are 
constructed),  then you know he won’t have very strong defenses for a 
certain amount of  time. If you quickly build a second gateway and 
“pump” (build nonstop)  zealots out of both of your gateways, straight 
toward his base, you can  do serious damage before he has time to 
defend. On the other hand, if  you wait too long, he will have ample 
defenses, and any attempted attack  will easily be repelled, and you’ll 
likely lose the game for missing  your opportunity. As I said before, to
 know when is the right time to do  anything, you need a bit of 
experience to know what is coming next,  based upon their build.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Timings</h2>
<p>Timings are the times throughout a game when something noteworthy 
takes place.  For example, in the previous example, the Zerg will be in a
 weak  defensive position for a window of time. However, knowing the 
best  precise time to attack is more than being aware of the window. A  
precisely timed attack is called a “Timing Attack”. So when would you  
want to attack this Zerg player? Every game varies somewhat, but a  
general rule is to attack right before a player gets a return on his  
investment. This is because the Zerg player’s army will grow more slowly
  than yours up until the point he starts getting a return. If he is  
building an army half as quickly as you until his expansion is  
saturated, then your advantage will steadily grow for the entire  
duration of the window. His army will be weakest in relative to yours  
the moment his expansion becomes saturated.  A common timing attack,  
therefore, is when the enemy is maynarding workers from his main to his 
 natural.</p>
<p>Specific example: Zerg players will often “14 hatch” “16 pool”, 
meaning  they build their expansion hatchery (Zerg equivalent to the 
nexus) at 14  supply, and then their spawning pool (allows them to build
 combat  units) at 16 supply. An appropriate response from a Protoss 
player who  already made a 12 gate (before scouting Zerg) is to, 
immediately after  scouting the enemy expansion, build another gateway, 
probably a 13 gate.  Save chronoboosts for the zealots to be produced 
from these structures,  make sure you build another pylon at about 14, 
and send your first  zealots immediately to the Zerg base to try and 
kill drones before he is  ready to defend. If done correctly, this 
attack is very hard to hold  off, depending on the distance between your
 mains.</p>
<p>This timing rule can be used for every kind of investment. If the 
enemy  has spent a significant amount of time and resources on tech, 
then  attack just before he can use that tech in his army.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Polish</h2>
<p>Polish is otherwise known as perfection of a strategy or build. 
Polish,  although subtle, can mean the difference between crushing 
defeat and  clear victory. Having one extra unit to defend an attack can
 mean the  successful defense of your expansion, and your eventual 
victory by  superior economy.<br>
The only way to polish is to carefully observe your own games from an  
objective perspective, find the places you could improve, and then  
practice. This goes for games whether you win or lose.<br>
For example, after successfully attacking an enemy, watch the replay of 
 the game. Were you doing the fundamentals the whole time you carried 
out  your attack? Was your attack timed correctly; could you have 
attacked a  bit sooner or later and been more successful? Was your 
attack executed  with proper micro?</p>
<p>Polishing all of these things will give you a smaller margin of error, and greater chances of success.</p>
<p>Another part of your build is your building placement. <strong>Building placement</strong>
 is the way you arrange your buildings for strategic purpose. The two  
most important kinds of building placements are walling your ramp/choke 
 and simcitying.</p>
<p>To wall your ramp or choke, build your buildings at the top of the  
ramp that leads into your main, or the choke that leads into your main  
or natural. As Protoss, you should leave one cell (game unit of  
distance) unblocked by buildings, to allow for your own units to pass  
through. To keep any enemies from getting inside, you can leave a single
  unit (such as a zealot) on hold position in that cell.</p>
<p>The point of walling your ramp or choke is to severely limit the  
number of enemy units that can actually attack your units or buildings. 
 This is especially effective against melee units.</p>
<p>To simcity, place your buildings in such a way as to create a wall of
  buildings, minerals, and vespene geysers, around your worker lines.  
There are several reasons why you might want to simcity instead of  
walling your ramp: It’s easier to pull probes(have probes attack  
invading units instead of gather, for a short time). If your ramp is  
very wide (such as on Scrap Station), it can be easier to complete a  
simcity instead. It doesn’t choke your ramp, meaning you can move large 
 numbers of units out of your base more quickly. It concentrates all of 
 your important structures in one small area, making it much easier to  
defend  everything into the mid and late game.</p>

<p>What I want to discuss here is one of the most important things in 
Starcraft 2 and that is your gaming mentality. Starcrat 2 is not like 
most games and requires a very high mental fortitude and mental strength
 to not let your emotions get the best of you and to stay on top of your
 game. Starcraft is a video game of Chess that requires you to always be
 thinking a couple moves ahead and being ready to counter any move made 
by your opponent.</p>

<h2>Starting Mindset</h2>
<p>You have to go into each game thinking you are the best player in the
 match, even if your opponent is favored. If you go into a game thinking
 your outmatched then you’ve lost the game before it even starts. It 
doesn’t matter your opponents record, you cannot fear anyone. If you go 
into each game with the same mindset thinking that if you are prepared 
and focus then you’ll be able to take on anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Rule #1 </strong><br>
Have a general straight forward sort of sense, of knowing what your  
going to be doing at the end of the game. Like I want these tech units, i
  want these upgrades and this amount of bases. Just know what your 
going  to be doing after you get an advantage<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>
</span><strong>Rule #2</strong><br>
Just scout every expo, because the worst thing is losing because of a hidden expo.</p>
<p><strong>Rule #3</strong><br>
This is probably the fastest way to lose the game. When you have a lead,
  you need to let that lead extend over a period of time. If you attack 
immediately after you beat his army, most times he will have an equal or
  less of a force than you in a defensive position. Just let that lead  
play out. But of course if it is obvious you can win, you know win but  
be really careful of attacking within say 5 minutes of you gaining an  
advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Rule #4</strong><br>
I mean its rather simple to know that the way a player would get back in
  the game is to nuke your mineral line or kill of an expo with 2 or 3  
units. So just make sure all your mineral lines are tight, and that you 
 will be okay from nydus worms, or mass drops. And if your already at an
  advantage, you don’t need that much more of an advantage. I mean sure 
you  want more of an advantage and harassing is good, but if you lose 4 
 templar, and a warp prism your kinda screwed.</p>

<h2>Staying Focused during a Rush</h2>
<p>A lot of times when a player gets rushed or get their economy damaged
 the immediately panic and lose focus on their original game plan. It is
 important to stay focused and level headed the entire game, try not to 
get to high and stay at an even level keeping your emotions in check. 
This will allow you to handle a rush more efficiently and get yourself 
quickly back on track to rebuild your economy and your base after a 
rush.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Taking your opponent out of their game</h2>
<p>As important as it is to stay calm and focus while being rushed and 
attacked it is also important to take your opponent out of their game by
 rushing them and damaging their economy. Most non-pro players will get 
frustrated and lose their psychological mind set after being attacked or
 losing a large part of their economy. It is important to take them out 
of their game early so they can’t focus on their normal strategy and 
build.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Winning Games</h2>
<p>Winning is the ultimate goal and although when you win you want to 
make sure you don’t start getting cocky, and thinking that your are 
invincible. Stay down to earth and take on each game the same as the 
next, if you start thinking your really good then you may stray from 
your normal strategy. I’m not saying don’t be proud of your wins, enjoy 
each win but know that there is always someone better than you out their
 that you need to beat next.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Losing Games</h2>
<p>Losing is not something I can ever get use to doing, although it is 
part of the game and everyone is going to lose. Although Losing is one 
of the best things that can happen to you, since you can learn something
 new after each loss. Every time you lose you should reflect upon the 
game and think what you did wrong, and what you could of done that might
 of given you the advantage and turned the game in your favor. I</p>
<p>After every loss I go back and watch the reply and see what I can 
improve on, it is important to not get to upset after a loss and try to 
learn from it and improve on your weakness the next game.</p>
<h3><strong>Tips</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Stay focused during rushes, don’t panic and focus on what you must do to recover</li>
<li>Do not Rage! Everyone is going to lose, learn from your loses and try to improve the next game</li>
<li>Watch your own Replays. You’ll learn a lot from watching your own replays</li>
<li>Try to take your opponent out of his game psychologically</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember the most important thing! Have fun, this is why your playing the game.</p>

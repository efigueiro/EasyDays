<p>Scouting is one of the most important things you can do in the game 
as it gives you information on your enemies build and what units they 
are getting allowing you to build the units to counter him.</p>
<p>In every game you should send one of your works such as an SCV, 
Probe, or Drone to scout your enemy’s base early game. You need to send 
them out around 9 or 10 supply and hot key the scout so you may micro 
him while still managing your base. I usually like to set my scout to 
Control Group #1 so while I’m still building my base I can quickly 
access him while I have him dance around the enemies base keeping him on
 the move and not letting him die.</p>

<p>The reason why you want to send a scout out so early is for two 
reasons. One you need to find out where the players base is on a map if 
the map has more than 2 spawning locations. Second you want to make sure
 they are not doing anything Cheesy. If you head into their base and you
 see that a Protoss doesn’t have a Gateway being built or that a Terran 
isn’t building a Barracks then you know they may be trying to proxy you 
and you need to then scout all around your base and get ready to defend 
against a cheese.</p>

<h2>Terran Scouting</h2>
<p>Besides sending a SCV to scout early game you can also build a 
barracks next to your opponents base and fly it over their base as a 
scout. This method is usually done mid game and is used instead of using
 a Scan on your opponent as you should be using a Mule instead since a 
Mule will collect 260+ minerals and a Barracks is only 150 minerals</p>

<h2>Protoss Scouting</h2>
<p>As Protoss besides scouting early game with your probe you’ll have a 
few options to keep an eye on your opponent. The first and most obvious 
is creating a observer from your robotics bay. This is ideally the best 
way to go as they are invisible and you can keep an eye on your 
opponent’s base as long as he doesn’t have any detectors.</p>
<p>If your opponent does have detectors and your not able to get an 
observer into his base then create a Phoenix and use the hallucination 
ability from a sentry to create a copy of the Phoenix and fly it over 
your enemies base. The great thing about this method is that even of the
 hallucinated phoenix dies you didn’t waste any resources as it was 
created with just energy from your Sentry.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Zerg Scouting</h2>
<p>Zerg has the ability to scout with overlords although early game it’s
 not always the best to send an overlord right into your opponents base.
 Overlords with out the speed upgrade from the Liar are generally very 
slow and 1 marine, stalker, or queen can easily dispatch of an overlord 
inside their base which can harm you early game and supply block you. 
This is why Zerg players usually use a drone to scout instead of an 
overlord early in the game while sending their overlords to cliffs in 
the middle of the map to give them sight of pathways to their base.</p>
<p>Once you get a Lair and get a the Overlord speed upgrade then it can 
be good idea to sacrifice an Overlord and fly into their opponents base 
to see what they are building. Some times you may be able to fly the 
overlord through their base to scout and have him make it out alive 
which you can then heal him with your queen.</p>

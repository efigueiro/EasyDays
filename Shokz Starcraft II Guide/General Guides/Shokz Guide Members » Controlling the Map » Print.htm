<p>Controlling the map should be a focus point of every game. When a 
player has control of the map they have control over the economy and 
almost always wins the game. In this guide I’m going to talk about the 
advantages of having map control, how to keep it, and what to do once 
you have map control.</p>
<h2>What is Map Control</h2>
<p>Map Control is where you control the map and all the expansions of 
the map with your army. By having map control your able to deny your 
opponent from expanding or letting him take control of any additional 
expansions. The player who has map control, controls the speed of the 
game as they can decide to expand and build up their army or move in on 
their opponent. It is very critical to not let your opponent gain 
control of the map because you will then be cornered in your base forced
 to attack when your not ready.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Gaining Map Control</h2>
<p>Gaining Control over the map is all about having a mobile army, you 
cannot sit back in your base base massing forces waiting to attack, you 
need to have your army out on the map not letting your opponent expand 
past his natural expansion. When taking map be aware of your opponents 
force, if you try to deny an expansion or control the map when you are 
out numbered or matched in army size you can lose the game.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Attacking with Map Control</h2>
<p>When you have map control you need to know when to attack and when to
 sit back and continue to Macro, because if you attack at the wrong time
 you can lose the battle and let your opponent gain control over the 
map. The key is to keep pressure on your opponent by constantly hitting 
him and if your not able to push into his base and win then pull back 
and continue to macro and then apply more pressure on him soon after.</p>
<p>Eventually when you have map control you’ll be able to push through 
their forces and win the game, although make sure that you keep up the 
unit production so that you don’t lose a main battle turning the control
 in their favor.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Let your opponent Turtle</h2>
<p>A Turtle is a player who will build a wall of defense at the front of
 their base or at the front of their expansion making it difficult to 
attack them while they sit back and tech. When you are facing a turtle 
they key to the game is slowly bleed them out of their minerals. With a 
turtle you will have complete control over the map since they will not 
come out of their base and this is where you need to expand across the 
map to gain control over the economy.</p>
<p>A Turtle is going to be making a timing attack waiting till he is 
ready to hit so you must have a balance of expanding and building forces
 so that you will be able to defend off any timing attack. Make sure 
that you are constantly scouting a turtle so that you know what he is 
going and when you think he will be ready to attack. When trying to 
scout a turtle you won’t be able to send a unit straight into a base so 
fly and observer, overlord or a barracks into their base to get the 
scouting info.</p>
<p>As long as you hold of any timing attack of the turtle and deny him 
any further expansions past their natural you will slowly win the game, 
these games are long and tiring but you will bleed him dry of resources 
as you continue to expand and macro your army if you deny him from 
expanding.</p>

<h1>Race Comparison</h1>
<p>When you first start out in Starcraft 2 you may be overwhelmed by 
just how diverse the three races are. All three races have different 
build and play styles, but once you understand each of the races 
mechanics you’ll be able to play all three.</p>
<p>For new players it is important that you try out each race and see 
which one fits your play style. Once you find the race you like the most
 than stick with it, as a new player it is not possible possible to 
master all three races and you must focus getting good at 1 at a time in
 order to be successful at Starcraft 2.</p>

<h2>Terran</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1006" title="Terran" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Race%20Comparison%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/Terran.jpg" alt="" height="200" width="660"></p>
<p>Terran is a heavy hitting powerful race that deals their damage with 
brute force. Terran is generally the easiest race to learn for beginners
 since they can relate to them as humans, the name of the buildings and 
units are easy to understand for a player who has never played SC2 and 
can start off with a strong infantry build.</p>
<p>While Terran is more of a basic race in the start of the game with 
Marines and Marauders they develop into probably the most diverse race 
in the game. There is an large amount of combination that a Terran 
player can use once they get to the mid and end game and can 
differentiate themselves with more than Zerg and Protoss in later games.</p>

<h2>Protoss</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1005" title="Protoss" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Race%20Comparison%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/Protoss.jpg" alt="" height="200" width="660"></p>
<p>The Protoss is a race of Psy Energy and Technology. The key feature  
in the Protoss build mechanics is that one probe is able to build  
multiple buildings at once so you don’t have to create multiple units to
  construct your base. Protoss has the strongest early game units in the
  game with Zealots and Stalkers although rely more on their power and 
the  ability to micromanage rather than masses of units.</p>
<p>Protoss have the ability to Chrono boost any building which will  
speed up the production of their units along with the ability to Warp  
units into battle once they upgrade their Gateways to Warpgates.</p>

<ul>
<li>Powerful and defensive units</li>
<li>Buildings warp themselves into play</li>
<li>Probes can build multiple structures at once</li>
<li>Photon Cannons attack both land and air and can detect invisible units</li>
<li>Regenerative Plasma Shields</li>
<li>Can use a Warp Prism as a substitute pylon matrix</li>
<li>Can warp units into the psionic matrix using a Warpgate</li>
<li>Colossi can traverse up and down terrain</li>
<li>Can use powerful Mothership abilities for defense</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Expensive and long build times</li>
<li>Buildings must be placed within psionic matrix</li>
<li>Buildings go offline out of psionic matrix</li>
<li>Colossi are susceptible to anti-air</li>
<li>Heavy vespene consumption</li>
</ul>

<h2>Zerg</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1007" title="Zerg" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Race%20Comparison%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/Zerg.jpg" alt="" height="200" width="660"></p>
<p>Zerg is also probably the hardest of the three races to get started  
with although once you learn the race’s mechanics they can be very  
powerful. The Zerg is all about numbers, their units are cheap and not  
as strong but can be made quickly and in the masses.</p>
<p>When playing as Zerg the ability to Macro is very important you must 
 expand and grown your economy to continue the high production of units 
 to overwhelm your opponent with sheer number of units.</p>
<table class="data" style="height: 260px;" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="465">

<th>Weaknesses</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Units are cheap and in the multiples</li>
<li>All land units have the ability to burrow underground</li>
<li>The Infestor and Roach can burrow and move underground</li>
<li>Hatchery can build 3 units at a time</li>
<li>Units heal automatically upon creep</li>
<li>Overlords provide supply, can create creep and fly</li>
<li>While the mutated form Overseer can detect and transport</li>
<li>Zerg defensive structures can uproot and walk around</li>
<li>Zerg gain a 30% speed boost while on creep</li>
<li>Can instantly transport all units anywhere using the Nydus Worm</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Buildings must be built on creep</li>
<li>Units are usually weak but in the numbers</li>
<li>Drones are lost when creating a building</li>
<li>Some zerg units have the ability to morph into strong variants</li>
</ul>
</td>

<h2>Choosing your Race</h2>
<p>While all three races have very different play styles the best thing 
to do is just try out each one, see which race you feel the most 
comfortable with and like and just go with it. As a new player it is 
very important that you get good with on race and focus on mastering 
every aspect of that race.</p>
<p>Once you feel that you the core mechanics down of your main race than
 you should go back and learn everything about the other two races even 
if you don’t plan on every playing them. The reason is the more you know
 about your enemy the better, if your your playing as Zerg against a 
Protoss player and he gets Colossus and you know nothing about Colossus 
since you’ve never played Protoss than you won’t know what units to 
create to counter the Colossus.</p>

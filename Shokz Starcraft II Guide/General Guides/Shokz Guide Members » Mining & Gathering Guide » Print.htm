					<div id="BlogContent"><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-29" title="General Guides" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Mining%20&amp;%20Gathering%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/GeneralGuides.jpg" alt="Starcraft 2 General Guides" height="148" width="660"></p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>Your economy is the gathering of minerals and gas, in most games the 
player who has the best economy has an advantage in the game and is a 
very important part to keeping a good Macro.</p>
<h2>Saturating Minerals</h2>
<p>The term Saturating Minerals means adding the optimal amount of 
workers (SCVs, Probes, Drones) to your mineral line. To earn the most of
 your minerals you should have 3 workers per mineral patch and there are
 8 minerals patches in a normal base so you should have 24 workers on 
minerals.</p>
<p>The same goes for Gas, you should have 3 workers harvesting gas per 
geyser. Most build orders have you get your gas early in the game, so 
make sure that you add 3 workers right away harvest from it.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-187" title="Starcraft 2 Minerals" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Mining%20&amp;%20Gathering%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/Starcraft-2-Minerals-e1274980444605.jpg" alt="" height="149" width="596"></p>
<p>Many times as the game goes on and you start building units, players 
will forget to continue to make workers and saturate their minerals. 
This is where having your main set as Control Group Hot key so you can 
quickly hit the number to select it and then build a worker while you 
continue to Macro your base.</p>
<p>As the game goes on and the time comes to expand your main minerals 
will start to be getting low, instead of building a all new workers for 
your expansion take half of the workers off your main and have them 
start harvesting from your expansion so you don’t have to build as many 
workers and the other half will finish harvesting whatever minerals 
remains from your main base.</p>
<hr>
<h2>High Yield Minerals</h2>
<p>High Yield Minerals are the gold mineral patches which you can find 
usually in the middle of over map. These minerals give you an economic 
edge as your workers are able to gather minerals at a faster rate 
allowing you to produce more units.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-306" title="HighYieldMinerals" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Mining%20&amp;%20Gathering%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/HighYieldMinerals.jpg" alt="" height="184" width="596"></p>
<p>The high yield minerals only have 6 mineral patches compared to the 
normal minerals 8 patches, but they provide a large increase in resource
 gathering. A worker gathers 5 minerals per trip from a normal mineral 
patch, where they gather 7 minerals per trip from a high yield mineral 
patch. That is a 40% increase in mineral mining which is huge jump to 
your economy.</p>
<p>As stated these high yield mineral patches are usually found around 
the center of the map and should be utilized as often as possible. They 
key is to have map control and have an active army so your able to 
expand quickly and protect your expansion. If a player takes control of a
 high yield mineral they will have a huge advantage in the game as their
 economy will be soaring above their opponents.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Vespine Gas</h2>
<p>Vespine Gas is the other resource that is gathered in Starcraft 2, to
 start gathering gas you need to create an your races gas collecting 
building on a Vespine Geyser and then you’ll be able to start gathering 
gas. There are two Vespine Geysers per base and like minerals you want 
to have 3 workers gathering gas per geyser.</p>
<p>There is no difference between Vespine Geysers at high yield minerals
 or at a normal base, they both gather the same amount of gas and it 
takes 3 workers to saturate each geyser.</p>

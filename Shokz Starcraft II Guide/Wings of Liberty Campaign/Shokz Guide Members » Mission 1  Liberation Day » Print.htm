<p>In your first mission you start off as the Rebel Commander Jim Raynor
 and a group of 5 rag-tag Marines. Your objective in this mission is to 
locate and destroy the Logistics Headquarters and free the citizens on 
Mar Sara from the control of the Dominion.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-961" title="M1Liberation-Start" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Mission%201%20%20Liberation%20Day%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/M1Liberation-Start.jpg" alt="" height="250" width="660"></p>
<p>Starting out you will get a pop up window asking if you would like to
 watch video tutorials on how to move / attack and the basics of the 
game. When you are ready to head out highlight your group of Marines and
 continue along the road until you come to 2 Dominion Marines, you will 
be shown a brief tutorial on how to attack enemy opponents.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-959" title="M1Liberation-Killing2Marines" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Mission%201%20%20Liberation%20Day%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/M1Liberation-Killing2Marines.jpg" alt="" height="306" width="660"></p>
<p>Once they are finished head north up the road and you will be taken 
to a cut scene of a Dominion Holoboard, you now have a new Bonus 
Objective to destroy 6 of 6 Dominion Holoboards. Right click the 
Holoboard while having your army selected to attack it, once you’ve 
destroyed the first Holoboard continue north up the road. You will come 
to an open area with a group of Dominion Marines behind a couple 
sandbags which out number you. This is when reinforcements will fly down
 to the ground in the middle of the Dominion Marines group and start 
attacking, quickly take your units and provide them support.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-956" title="M1Liberation-BackupsCalldown" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Mission%201%20%20Liberation%20Day%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/M1Liberation-BackupsCalldown.png" alt="" height="249" width="660"></p>
<p>Once you finish taking out the Dominion’s forces you can join up with
 the rest of the reinforcements. To the left of you in the center of the
 town will be the 2nd Dominion Holoboard for you to destroy. Once you 
take that out go directly south&nbsp; and destroy the 3rd Dominion 
Holoboard which will be guarded by 1 Marine.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-952" title="M1Liberation-3rdHoloBoard" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Mission%201%20%20Liberation%20Day%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/M1Liberation-3rdHoloBoard.jpg" alt="" height="259" width="660"></p>
<p>Than lastly before you head north towards the Logistics Headquarters 
follow the path to the left where you will find the 4th Dominion 
Holoboard to destroy.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-953" title="M1Liberation-4thHoloBoard" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Mission%201%20%20Liberation%20Day%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/M1Liberation-4thHoloBoard.jpg" alt="" height="254" width="660"></p>
<p>Once you’ve destroyed the 4th Holoboard follow the path to the west 
north to the Logistics Headquarters, there will be a cut scene showing 
the civilians being held captive by the Dominion. After the scene engage
 the Dominion forces, their transport vehicle has a turret on it which 
you will need to destroy. Once you take out the Dominion forces the 
civilians will than join you in your rebellion, to left of where the 
Transport was is the 5th Dominion Holoboard to be destroyed.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-960" title="M1Liberation-KillingTransport" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Mission%201%20%20Liberation%20Day%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/M1Liberation-KillingTransport.png" alt="" height="256" width="660"></p>
<p>Head under the gate into the Logistics Headquarters camp where to the
 right will be the final Dominion Holoboard. The civilians which you’ve 
rescued will join you in the attack against the final Dominion forces.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-954" title="M1Liberation-5thHoloBoard" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Mission%201%20%20Liberation%20Day%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/M1Liberation-5thHoloBoard.jpg" alt="" height="283" width="660"></p>
<p>Once you’ve eliminated all the forces take your army and destroy the 
Logistics Headquarters. Once you’ve take it down you’ve completed your 
first mission in Starcraft 2 and are ready to take on one of the best 
campaigns made by blizzard to date!</p>

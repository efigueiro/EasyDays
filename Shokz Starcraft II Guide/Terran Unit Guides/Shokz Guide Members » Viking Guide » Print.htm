<p>Vikings are Terran’s main anti-air unit and an all around very 
versatile unit in the Terran army. The Viking has two attack modes 
Fighting Mode which is their air based mode and Assault Mode which is 
their ground attack mode. This allows the viking to be used in many 
situations but their main purpose and where they excel is in their 
Fighting Mode being used as anit-air. They have very long range while in
 their flying mode allowing them to snipe out other air units and are a 
good counter to almost every air unit in the game.</p>

<h2>Skills and Strategies</h2>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-653" title="fighter_mode" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Viking%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/fighter_mode.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Fighter Mode</strong>:
 Transforms the Viking into Fighter Mode. In this mode Vikings fly, but 
they can only attack air targets. While in Fighting mode the Viking can 
out range almost any other air unit and is the best choice for anti-air 
when playing as Terran.</p>

 Transforms the Viking to Assault Mode. In this mode Vikings move on the
  ground and can only attack ground targets. This is very useful in 
battles if you need a little extra ground support and can help turn the 
tide of the battle. Vikings in Assault mode are not the strongest unit 
and should not be made for this purpose but as secondary feature to be 
used when needed.

<ul class="clear">
<li>Use Vikings to find opponent expansions and then drop down into Assault mode behind the mineral line to take out their workers.</li>
<li>Use Vikings to harass opponents expansions and main mineral fields</li>
<li>While in Fighting mode take out Overlords around the map to try to supply block your Zerg opponent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Against other Races</h2>
<p><strong>Vs Protoss</strong>: Vikings can be very useful in a Protoss 
match-up, they are the best counter to Colossus since Air units can 
attack Colossus since they are so tall and with the Vikings long range 
they are able to shoot them from a distance since Colossus are usually 
behind the Protoss forces. Another great use for Vikings are when your 
opponent goes for Void Rays, as Vikings are the best Terran counter for 
Void Rays and can out range them to keep them at a distance.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Terran</strong>: Vikings are good in Terran games to 
harass since a lot of players will build expansions and fly them away 
off to an island so you will easily be able to fly a couple Vikings over
 to their expansion, take Assault mode and take out their SCVs. Vikings 
are also very useful against any type of Banshee build, since Banshees 
can only attack ground a couple Vikings will easily take out a group of 
Banshees.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Zerg</strong>: Vikings are a decent counter to Mutalisks 
and is usually the only time you would want to get vikings in a Zerg 
game. You can use Vikings to pick off overlords scouting the map or find
 the group of their Overlord supply and take them out to take them below
 the supply count but other than that Vikings aren’t used a lot in a 
Zerg match-up. If the game ever goes into a late game and your opponent 
starts to go Brood Lords then Vikings will be the best counter, although
 it’s rare for games to go that far.</p>

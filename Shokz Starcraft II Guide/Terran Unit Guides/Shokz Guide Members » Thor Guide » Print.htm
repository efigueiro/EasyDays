<p>“Thor is Here”! Thors are a powerful high end unit which can attack 
both air and ground and has a ton of hit points. They are a decent unit 
for anti-air and a very powerful unit when being backed up by siege 
tanks and marauders.</p>

<h2>Skills and Strategies</h2>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-686" title="250mm_strike_cannons" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Thor%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/250mm_strike_cannons.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">250mm Strike Cannons</strong>:
 This allows the thor to fire at a single unit or structure, stunning 
the target and dealing 500 damage over 6 seconds. This is a very 
powerful ability that can be used when dealing with other high end units
 such as Ultralisk, Battlecruisers, or Colossus to take them down 
quickly. You can also use the attack to try to quickly take down 
buildings during a Thor drop or when invading their base.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thor Drop Guide – Coming Soon.</li>
<li>During battle use a couple SCVs to heal Thors while being attacked.</li>
<li>You can call down a mule anywhere on the map where you Thors are to heal them.</li>
<li>Use 250mm Strike Cannon to quickly take down opponents Nexus, Command Center, or Hive.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Against other Races</h2>
<p><strong>Vs Protoss</strong>: Thors are not the strongest unit to go 
against Protoss, since Immortals can quickly dispose of them along with 
zealots. Thors are a decent match up if your opponent is going a very 
heavy stalker build but if he is more zealots and immortals then stay 
away from Thors. You can also build Thors if you plan on doing a Thor 
Drop as a harassment but in a straight battle they are not the best 
idea.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Terran</strong>: Thors work well against other Teran 
players since you can use their cannons to quickly take out their Siege 
tanks and when teamed up your own Siege tanks they provide great meat to
 protect your tanks from being focused fired on.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Zerg</strong>: This is where I tend to usually get Thors 
the most is when I play against Zerg. Thors are very strong against 
Hydralisks since they are able to 1 shot them and are very good at 
defending against Mutalisk rushes. Thors do splash damage against air 
and a couple of Thors can easily take out a group of Mutalisks when they
 are grouped together. The main thing you have to watch out for are 
Zerglings, they are very quick and if they surround a Thor they will 
quickly take him down with, if you are going a heavy Thor build try to 
have them backed up by a couple Hellions so they can take out any 
Zerglings that try to surround your Thors.</p>

<p>The Ghost is one of the trademark units of the Terran army. They are a
 support unit and are used for their special abilities rather then<br>
as an attack unit. Ghost are made from a Barracks with a Tech Lab, although require a Ghost Academy before you can train Ghosts.</p>

<h2>Special Abilities</h2>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-632" title="snipe" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Ghost%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/snipe.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Snipe</strong>:
 This ability allows the ghost to snipe biological units from a distance
 with a 45 damage attack that ignores all armor. The ability has a range
 of 10 and can be shift queued for multiple snipes in a row. With a 
couple ghosts and good micro your able to take out a a large group of 
biological units very quickly with this ability by quickly sniping them 
all while cloaked.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-630" title="cloak" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Ghost%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/cloak.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Cloak</strong>:
 This allows your ghost to become invisible while slowly draining it’s 
energy and will remained cloaked till canceled or your energy runs out. 
The cloak ability is very useful and is used to get off most of the 
other’s ghosts abilities such as Snipe or Nukes with out being seen as a
 Ghost is a fragile unit.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-631" title="emp_round" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Ghost%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/emp_round.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">EMP Round</strong>:
 The EMP Round Skill allows you to fire off a AoE EMP shot which will 
remove all shields&nbsp; and energy in the area of any unit by 100. This
 is most commonly used when fighting against Protoss as all Protoss 
units have shields and this will essentially take their health down half
 way if used right before you enter battle.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-633" title="tactical_nuke" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Ghost%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/tactical_nuke.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Tactical Nuke</strong>:
 NUCLEAR LAUNCH DETECTED! This is the Ghost’s Trademark skill which 
allows you to launch a nuclear missile at a target spot that deals 300 
damage (+200 to buildings) in a 10 range radius. All nukes must first be
 trained in Ghost Academy before they can be launched. Tactical Nukes 
are a very powerful skill although must be used in the right situation, 
once launched it takes a couple seconds for the nuke to come down so 
trying to cast a nuke on a mobile army is not a good idea. One of the 
best uses for nukes is to cast one on your opponents minerals which 
would allow you to kill all of his workers.</p>

<h2>Against Other Races</h2>
<p><strong>Vs Protoss</strong>: When playing against Protoss this is 
where Ghost are the most useful. Any time you can get an EMP off on your
 opponents army right before a battle will give you a huge advantage as 
it will disable all the Protoss shields essentially taking their health 
down 100 HP. Using EMP on High Templars is also a very important tactic,
 since High Templars are able to quickly dispose of your army and by 
casting EMP on them you will deplete their energy leaving them useless.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Zerg</strong>: This is a match up where you can really use
 your Snipe ability, having a couple of cloaked ghosts in your army your
 able to quickly take out Hydarlisks and Zerglings with the snipe 
ability with good micro. EMP is also very important if you are going a 
Mech build with Thor, as a lot of Zerg players are now starting to get 
Infestors to mind control Thors in TvZ match ups and by casting EMP on 
them will drain their energy leaving them unable to take control over 
your Thors.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Terran</strong>: Ghost are not of very much use when 
playing another Terran player, one strategy that can be used is of 
course nuking your opponents mineral fiends, or you can take a 2 cloaked
 into your opponents base and snipe out their SCVs to damage their 
economy.</p>

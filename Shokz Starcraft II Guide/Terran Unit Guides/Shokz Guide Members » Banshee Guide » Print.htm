<p>Banshees are light armored air units which can only attack ground and
 has the ability to be cloaked with an upgrade. The Banshee is a very 
popular unit to air rush with due to the cloak ability and is very good 
at harassing and killing workers if your opponent doesn’t have any 
detection.</p>

<h2>Skills and Strategies</h2>
<p><strong><img class="size-full wp-image-630 alignleft" title="cloak" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Banshee%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/cloak.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Cloak</strong>:
 This skill Cloaks the Banshee, preventing enemy units from seeing or 
attacking it. A cloaked unit will only be revealed by detector units or 
effects. This is very useful in attacking opponents economy, a couple 
expansions can quickly take out an entire force of workers and if your 
opponent forget to get any detection you can take out his entire army 
also.</p>

<li><a href="http://shokzguide.com/members/terran-guides/terran-11-starport-rush-guide/">11 Starport Rush Guide</a></li>
<li>Take out any detection units first such as Photon Cannons / Turrets</li>
<li>Hide your Starport away from your main structures this way if your 
opponent scouts he may not see the Starport and not expect banshees</li>
<li>Use Vikings to backup your group of Banshees, the Vikings will take 
out any air units while the Banshees will handle the ground units</li>
</ul>

<h2>Against other Races</h2>
<p><strong>Vs Protoss</strong>: Banshees are very powerful support unit 
against Protoss, when mixed in your army and cloaked they are able to do
 a great amount of damage while their only threat in Stalkers. You have 
to watch out for Void Rays, although if they go that route you can then 
start massing Vikings.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Terran:</strong> Terran players have the ability to Scan 
which allows them to have detection any time they need it as long as 
they have the energy, which makes banshees less useful against Terran 
players. You can use them to harass their minerals and once they bring 
units over and scan then fly away, but against a good player they will 
easily be able to defend it. In the lower level leagues they should work
 quite well.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Zerg</strong>: Banshees are good against Zerg if you rush 
them with them. Zerg doesn’t really get any anti-air until they make 
their Liar and then Hydralisks so if you get banshees out while the Zerg
 player still has only Roaches or Zerlings you will be very well off, 
but once he has Hydralisks he will easily be able to defend them off.</p>

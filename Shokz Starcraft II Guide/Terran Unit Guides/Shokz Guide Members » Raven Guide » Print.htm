<p>The Raven is Terran’s air support unit which is the replacement of 
the Science Vessel in the original Starcraft. It is a flying unit that 
can detected cloaked units and has a ray of special abilities which can 
quickly turn the tide of any battle if not a game. When I’m playing 
Terran I always try to get at least 1 if not more Ravens later on in the
 game as if you can use their special abilities right they will be one 
of your most powerful units in your army and is a unit which requires 
good micro but has a huge payout.</p>

<h2>Skills and Strategies</h2>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-675" title="detector" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Raven%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/detector.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Detector</strong>:
 The Raven is able to detected any cloaked / burrowed unit making it the
 only portable detection unit for Terran. Detection also allows you to 
detect any hallucinated units.</p>

<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-673" title="build_auto_turret" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Raven%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/build_auto_turret.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Build Auto Turret</strong>:
 This ability allows the Raven to drop an Auto-Turret at any location 
which lasts for 180 seconds and will attack anything within its range. 
These are very useful for harassment as a couple of these dropped behind
 your opponents minerals will quickly take out their workers while the 
Raven can fly away once they are placed.</p>
<p>You can also use Auto Turrets to block your opponent off from 
entering a choke point or as extra offense in a battle, I tend not to 
use them in battle as they some of the other Raven’s abilities are more 
beneficial and tend to only use Auto-Turrets to harass my opponents 
minerals.</p>
<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-674" title="build_point_defense_drone" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Raven%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/build_point_defense_drone.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Build Point Defense Drone</strong>:
 This is an automated defensive laser that intercepts enemy projectiles.
 They last for 180 seconds and start with 200 energy and will shoot down
 20 ranged attacks before running out of energy. This is probably the 
Raven’s most useful ability, by placing&nbsp; 2 of these down in front 
of your army right before you start a battle will give you a huge 
advantage. They will shoot down 40 ranged attacks preventing them from 
hitting your units.</p>
<p>As you would guess this is very useful against any unit that has 
ranged attack as it prevents the attack completely while allowing your 
units to continue their attack so you can quickly take out your 
opponents army out without taking a lot of damage.</p>
<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-676" title="seeker_missile" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Raven%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/seeker_missile.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Hunter Seeker Missile:</strong>
 Allows the Raven to launch a missile that chases down its target. The 
Missile will chase down the target for up to 15 seconds dealing 100+ 
area damage.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Against other Races</h2>
<p><strong>Vs Protoss</strong>: Ravens are useful when playing Protoss 
if your opponent is massing a lot of stalkers, you’ll be able to use 
Point Defense Drone to eliminate their attack when you start the battle 
and also Hunter Seeker Missile if he has the stalkers grouped up. When 
scouting the Protoss if you see a Dark Templar shrine you will want to 
get a Raven out ASAP so you do not have to waste your scans all the time
 trying to take out the Dark Templars.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Terran</strong>: Hunter Seeker Missile is very useful 
against Marine and Marauders balls, one HSM will take down large group 
of M&amp;M ball while also droping a Point Defense Drone during battle 
to shoot down any of the Marines and Marauder shots.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Zerg</strong>: Just like with the other two races if Zerg 
is massing Hydralisks then a Point Defense Drone will be very useful 
while in battle as it will shoot down any attacks form the Hydralisks, 
if you have the energy Hunter Seeker Missile will also do very well 
against a large bunched up group of Hydras and Zerglings.</p>

<p>Reapers are a unique unit with the ability to jump up and off cliffs,
 and move quickly across the map. They are light weight unit which is 
very weak when being attacked which is why they are mainly just used as a
 harassment unit to try to damage their employs economy. They can also 
be used to kite melee units such as zealots and zerglings by 
hitting-and-running. They have a secondary attack where they throw 
grenades at buildings which causes a good amount of damage.</p>

<h2>Reaper Skills and Strategies</h2>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-668" title="jet_pack" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Reaper%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/jet_pack.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Nitro Pack</strong>:
 Is a Reaper upgrade trained from the Tech Lab of a barracks, which 
increases the movement speed of your reapers. The upgrade cost 50 
minerals an 50 vespene and is worth the upgrade if you plan to do a 
heavy Reaper rush or harassment.</p>
<ul class="clear">
<li><a href="http://shokzguide.com/members/terran-guides/reaper-rush-guide/">Reaper Rush Guide</a></li>
<li>When Harassing your main target should be to take out their workers, try to damage their economy</li>
<li>Don’t use the front door! Reapers can jump up and off cliffs so sneak into your opponents base through the side or back.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Against Other Races</h2>
<p><strong>Vs Protoss</strong>: When going against Protoss you want to 
try to kill as many probes as possible, if your opponent gets zealots 
you will be able to kite them around his base by hitting them and 
running. Once the Protoss gets a stalker then your days are numbered and
 you should focus on getting as many drones as possible before the 
stalker takes you out.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Zerg</strong>: It is tough to take on Zerg with Reapers, 
as Zerglings on creep can quickly catch up and surround your Reapers, 
and zerglings with their Metablic Speed upgrade can catch them when they
 are off creep also. Although one strategy that works very well is when a
 Zerg player goes for a quick expansion you can take an SCV and build a 
Bunker next to his expansion and put 2 – 3 Reapers in the bunker which 
will dispose of any zerglings defending the expansion and then quickly 
take out the expansion with their grenades which they throw at 
buildings.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Terran</strong>: Attacking Terran with Reapers is a lot 
like Protoss, your main focus will to kill as many SCVs as possible and 
your able to kite marines, although once they get a marauder then they 
will easily be able to defend their minerals so getting your reapers out
 ASAP is crucial when attacking another Terran player.</p>

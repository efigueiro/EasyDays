<p>Marines are the basic infantry unit for Terran, they are a cheap 
light weight unit that can attack both ground and air. Marines by 
themselves are one of the weakest fighting units in the game although 
make a great support unit and when mixed with a combination of units 
such as marauders and hellions can be very strong and effective.</p>

<h2>Marine Upgrades</h2>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-574" title="stimpack" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Marine%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/stimpack.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Stimpack</strong>:
 is an upgraded that is researched from the Tech Lab, which increases 
the movement speed and the firing rate for both marines and marauders 
for 15 seconds at the cost of HP. Each time you cast stimpack it reduces
 the HP of the marine by 10 but is very useful in battle as it basically
 doubles your damage output and movement speed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stimpacks are great to use at the start of a battle, as you will get
 the most out of the 15 seconds and help deal out the most amount of 
damage.</li>
<li>With the upgraded Combat Shield ability which adds 10 hp to the marine, using Stimpack will revert your HP back to the default.</li>
<li>Stimpacks do not stack, casting it twice in a row will only make you
 lose an additional 10 HP and not give you any additional benefit.</li>
<li>When casting Stimpack a green lightning bolt will appear and once 
Stimpack fads you will see a red lightning bolt above their head.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-573" title="combat_shield" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Marine%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/combat_shield.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Combat Shield</strong>:
 is an upgrade that is researched from the Tech Lab, which increase the 
marines maximum HP by 10 HP. This upgrade is very useful if you go a 
heavy marine build, if your only going to get a couple marines to hold 
off a rush then it will not be very beneficial.</p>

<h2>Against Other Races</h2>
<p><strong>Vs. Protoss</strong>: Marines are a good support unit against
 Protoss although cannot hold their own against them alone. In early 
game Zealots will easily dispose of a marine based army but do well when
 mixed in with a marauders. If you wall in your base get a marine or two
 behind your wall to defend against any early rush. The one area Marines
 do excel at when facing Protoss is when they go Void Rays, Marines are 
very strong against void rays and if you Stimpack a group of marines 
they can easily take out a group of void rays.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Zerg</strong>: Marines are a great choice against Zerg, 
they are very strong and effective vs zerglings and a zergling rush and 
do well against Hydralisks also. When mixed with a combo of marauders 
with a few medivacs this will be a very strong army for any Zerg player 
to handle. Marines are also very strong against Mutalisks and are a 
great counter to a Mutalisk rush, you do have to watch out for Banlings,
 as they are able to take out a group of marines very easily and 
quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Terran:</strong> Marines are not the strongest when 
playing another Terran player, most of the Terran units like Marauders, 
Siege Tanks, and Hellions can take marines out very quickly. Marines are
 good against Banshees if you have enough of them but you will usually 
want to have vikings that late in the game. Try to only use marines as a
 support unit in any Terran army to add cheap DPS.</p>

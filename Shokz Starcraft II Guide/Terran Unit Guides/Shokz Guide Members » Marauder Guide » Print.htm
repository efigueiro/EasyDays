<p>The Marauder is Terran’s armored ground unit which attacks only 
ground units, aka Black Rocket Man. Marauders are a great addition to 
the Terran infantry as they are a very powerful ground unit that in 
numbers can be very powerful. They work great in a combination of 
marines which is known as M&amp;M Ball which is used as a great rush and
 very powerful against any combination of any unit.</p>

<h2>Marauder Upgrades</h2>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-574" title="stimpack" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Marauder%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/stimpack.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Stimpack</strong>:
 is an upgraded that is researched from the Tech Lab,  which increases 
the movement speed and the firing rate for both marines  and marauders 
for 15 seconds at the cost of HP. Each time you cast  stimpack it 
reduces the HP of the marine by 10 but is very useful in  battle as it 
basically doubles your damage output and movement speed.</p>
<ul class="clear">
<li>Stimpacks are great to use at the start of a battle, as you will get
  the most out of the 15 seconds and help deal out the most amount of  
damage.</li>
<li>Stimpacks do not stack, casting it twice in a row will only make you
  lose an additional 10 HP and not give you any additional benefit.</li>
<li>When casting Stimpack a green lightning bolt will appear and once  
Stimpack fads you will see a red lightning bolt above their head.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-620" title="concussive_shells" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Marauder%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/concussive_shells.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Concussive Shells</strong>:
 is an upgrade that is also researched from the Tech Lab which allows 
the marauder to slow the movement speed of any unit by 50% on attack. 
This is a great ability and should be researched any time you are going 
to go a heavy marauder based army.</p>
<ul class="clear">
<li>Concussive Shells allows you to kite melee units like Zealots and Roaches</li>
<li>You can chase down enemies as they flee Stimpack and Concussive Shells to slow them down and kill them</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Against Other Races</h2>
<p><strong>Vs Protoss</strong>: Marauders are great against almost all 
Protoss units, they are able to kite Zealots when they have concussive 
shells and are very strong against stalkers and Immortals. The one unit 
you have to watch out for is Colossus, when you see your opponent has 
them you will need to Stim up and focus fire them down quickly as they 
will eat the marauders up very quickly. It is also important to scout 
Protoss a lot to make sure they are not getting Void Rays as marauders 
against any air with no backup are dead in the water.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Zerg</strong>: Marauders are a great unit against Zerg as 
well as they are very strong vs Roaches and are good against Hydralisks.
 The main worry you need to watch out for is zerglings as they are very 
week against them although with marines or hellions as backup they can 
dispatch a group of zerglings very quickly, also watch out for Mutalisks
 which you would then need to back up your marauders with anti air such 
as Mainres, Thors or Vikings.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Terran</strong>: Marauders against Terran are very 
dependent on what your Terran opponent is going as most Terran players 
eventually lead to a Thor / Siege Tank build or Air build this makes 
Marauders of little important in a Terran based game, unless you are 
rushing. They are a great unit to rush early game against Terran before 
they get Siege Tanks, or Air and are also great at defending against 
Reaper rush once Concussive Shells is researched.</p>

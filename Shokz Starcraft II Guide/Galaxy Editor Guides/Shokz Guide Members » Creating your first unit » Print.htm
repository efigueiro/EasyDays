<p>Ok here we will start with creating your first Unit. In this tutorial  we will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>going over the basics of the Data Editor.</li>
<li>Creating a whole new Unit easily, not just editing over an  existing one.</li>
<li>Placing it on your map.</li>
<li>Testing the map.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="w-step-1-getting-to-the-data-editor">Step 1: Getting to the Data  Editor</h2>
<p>Create a new Map, dimensions dont matter, nor does tile set or  
anything, although make sure dependencies is set to Melee (Liberty)</p>
<p>In the map load up the Data Editor [F7].</p>
<p>Here you want to make sure that you have the Units tab open to do so  follow this picture reference:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-477" title="Map Editor" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Creating%20your%20first%20unit%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/nh087r-e1277318001702.png" alt="" height="427" width="660"></p>
<p>Ok so now you have the Units tab open and should the window should  look like this:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-481" title="t4ww1z" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Creating%20your%20first%20unit%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/t4ww1z-e1277318411957.png" alt="" height="427" width="660"></p>
<p>If it doesnt, Make sure all the orange buttons are clicked as mine  are.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="w-step-2-exploring-the-data-editor">Step 2: Exploring the Data  Editor</h2>
<p>There (for this example at least) are only 4 points to the data  editor that are really important and here they are:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-467" title="Map Editor" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Creating%20your%20first%20unit%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/2r55174-e1277318477348.png" alt="" height="427" width="660"></p>
<ul>
<li>1 Object List  List of all the objects that can be used on your map, and where the  objects come from.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2 Fields  List of Fields that go with a selected Object</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>3 Values  Values of the fields for an object</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>4 Data Type Selector  You already used this once! chooses between all the type of data you can  use for objects.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="w-step-3-creating-that-unit">Step 3: Creating that unit!</h2>
<p>In this Example we will be making a modified Marine. Now since we are
  making a unit thats based on another unit we have 2 options. 1) Make 
it  from scratch and make our heads explode or 2) chill and take it 
easy.  Well guess what we will do a little of Both</p>
<p>Right Click in the Object list and choose add object. that should net  you with this little window here.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-474" title="ab2krc" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Creating%20your%20first%20unit%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/ab2krc.png" alt="" height="364" width="316"></p>
<p>For name type in what ever you want to call it, ill be naming mine,  
Marinie, just so the other Marines can make fun of him. after you choose
  a name and type it in, just hit the box that says Suggest, and it will
  create an ID that works pretty well. Leave Defines Default Values  
unchecked, Leave Based On at Default Settings (Unit), also leave Show  
Non-Default unchecked, For Object family choose Melee (It really doesnt 
 matter), Race choose Terran, Object Type choose Unit (When choosing 
this  you should see a lot of other Type that would be fun to play with 
after  this tutorial huh =P), and Choose Copy From: and pick Marine from
 the  drop down box.</p>
<p>If that wall of Text lost you, just make your box look like this =P</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-471" title="30tjlvr" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Creating%20your%20first%20unit%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/30tjlvr.png" alt="" height="364" width="316"></p>
<p>Now hit ok!</p>
<p>Now Marinie has finally found his place among objects. Good for him  
for finally being accepted! Now lets go ahead and put him on the Battle 
 Field! Minimize the data editor (Or just alt tab) to get back to the  
Terrain Editor, make sure you are in the Unit Layer (If not just hit U  
or go to Layer &gt; Unit at the top). In the Tool box, make sure Player 1
  is selected, in the 3rd drop down box make sure Terran is selected and
  in the 4th make sure Unit is selected. if that lost you again heres a 
 picture for reference</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-470" title="25gf4p4" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Creating%20your%20first%20unit%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/25gf4p4-e1277319200482.png" alt="" height="507" width="660"></p>
<p>Now you will see a button that has a Little Green Zealot on it, when 
 you hover over it it will say Marinie (Or what ever you named the 
Unit),  click it and go place it on the ma….. wait its not showing up! 
we  need to create an actor class for it now!</p>
<p>Pull up your Data Editor again and go to Data Type (Important thing  
number 4!) and choose Actors. A new Tab for Actors will open up and alot
  more Objects will appear. Scroll down in the list until you find 
Marine  and right click it and choose Duplicate like so</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-463" title="1zoapi1" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Creating%20your%20first%20unit%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/1zoapi1-e1277319267767.png" alt="" height="427" width="660"></p>
<p>Another Window will come up asking what exactly to duplicate, just 
stick  a check box in everything and hit ok. after a few seconds another
  object will be created named Marine Copy. The name really isnt that  
important for now what matters is the token in the fields. Select to  
Value for unitName and Right Click and choose Modify Value</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-479" title="o6edyo" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Creating%20your%20first%20unit%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/o6edyo-e1277319477129.png" alt="" height="426" width="660"></p>
<p>a Small window will show up with a single Drop down box, Find Marinie  (or what ever you named it), select it, and hit ok.</p>
<p>Now! Minimize the Data editor again, pull up the terrain editor and  
try placing Marinie like before. Yay! If everything was done right he  
should show up now! Lets all do a happy dance.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-476" title="httcb8" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Creating%20your%20first%20unit%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/httcb8-e1277319525815.png" alt="" height="507" width="660"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="w-custom-weapon">Custom Weapon</h2>
<p>Ok So Marinie has been getting made fun of for his ridiculous name  
and decided to get personal, Lets make him a new Weapon to completely  
own the other guys’ (or them &gt;.&gt;)</p>
<p>Back in the Data Editor Select the Data Type Weapons from the drop  
down box. Right click anywhere in the object lest and hit, add new  
object. Name it Marinie’s Weapon and have it suggest an ID, Set the Race
  to Terran and copy From Marine – Gauss Rifle. again here is a cheat  
sheet:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-462" title="1z20tn5" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Creating%20your%20first%20unit%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/1z20tn5.png" alt="" height="363" width="316"></p>
<p>Hit OK. Now to Edit our Weapon, Marinie, because of his social  
issues, started taking way too much Stim packs on the down low and now  
hes permanently hyped up. So lets edit his weapon to reflect this.</p>
<p>Find the Field for Period and double click the Value of it, another  
small window will pop up, type in the half of that value (0.4304) and  
hit ok</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-472" title="Map Editor" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Creating%20your%20first%20unit%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/535nc-e1277319670668.png" alt="" height="426" width="660"></p>
<p>Alright, This is Fixed, if you want to test the map you can, just hit
  the test map button and have fun, but im not, because now Marinie is  
raging and wants more power!!!!</p>
<p>So in the fields find Effect, this is used for damage but wait… its  
not a value that we can change! its an Effect. So! Time to choose a new 
 Data Type but this time choose Effects.</p>
<p>Right click in the object list, Create a new one. Name it Marinie’s  
Weapon, MANUALLY set the ID to Marinie (again, doesnt matter, could just
  hit suggest but we are doing this just so it stays neat) Set Effect  
Type to Effect Damage Set race to Terran and hit ok</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-465" title="2m68nz7" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Creating%20your%20first%20unit%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/2m68nz7.png" alt="" height="363" width="316"></p>
<p>Ok there are only two values to change here, Kind, and Amount. Set Kind  to Ranged and Amount to 50 like so</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-475" title="av3s3s" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Creating%20your%20first%20unit%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/av3s3s-e1277321095522.png" alt="" height="427" width="660"></p>
<p>Now the Weapon Damage is set up properly! Time to fix it so we  actually do that much damage.</p>
<p>Click Back to the weapons tab and choose Marinie’s Weapon if its not 
 already selected. There are two fields we have to update. Effect as  
stated earlier and Damage Display Effect. Effect will adjust the Damage,
  and Damage Display Effect will set the value on the tooltip when you  
hover over the weapon in game.</p>
<p>So change both of these to Marinie’s Weapon</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-464" title="Map Editor" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Creating%20your%20first%20unit%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/2gy8yo8-e1277321240162.png" alt="" height="426" width="660"></p>
<p>Now it will help if we Equip the weapon to Marinie. go Back to the 
Unit  tab and find the field for Weapons + and double click on the 
value. a  Window should come up that just has a table with one entry. 
Click on  that entry and In the weapon drop down box choose Marinie’s 
Weapon and  then hit ok</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-480" title="snph" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Creating%20your%20first%20unit%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/snph.png" alt="" height="317" width="529"></p>
<p>Now lets optimize The map real fast  for testing.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="w-map-optimizing">Map Optimizing</h2>
<p>Ok first thing is first, lets only have one Marinie on the map  
placed, So if you were like me and got really excited when the model  
showed up and placed a lot of Marinies lets get rid of them all but one.
  Go back to the Terrain Editor and depending on your last action here  
selecting already placed units might be confusing. If your cursor isnt a
  little white arrow to select units with just press the spacebar and it
  should revert back to the selection cursor, now you can select units  
just like you do in game.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-466" title="2qvth0y" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Creating%20your%20first%20unit%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/2qvth0y-e1277349103147.png" alt="" height="507" width="660"></p>
<p>Now with them all select them, make them explode by hitting the 
Delete  Key, yea you hear that? you thought i was kidding about the 
explode. Now  just as we did earlier add another Marinie just one this 
time! Also add  some normal grunt marines for player 2, so Marinie can 
release some  anger!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-482" title="Map Editor" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Creating%20your%20first%20unit%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/w8uydl-e1277349169798.png" alt="" height="507" width="660"></p>
<p>Now if you followed my tutorial exactly you made a map for melee,  
obviously this isnt going to be a melee map so we have to change some  
triggers so we dont automatically end the game when we start. This isnt a
  Trigger tutorial so stay with me, imma just talk you through one 
simple  edit and we are done.</p>
<p>Launch the Trigger Editor and you should see this</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-473" title="2585i4p" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Creating%20your%20first%20unit%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/2585i4p-e1277349226741.png" alt="" height="481" width="660"></p>
<p>Now You see where it says “Melee – Set default melee options for all  players” Select that and Hit Delete</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-461" title="1fip1c" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Creating%20your%20first%20unit%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/1fip1c-e1277349276431.png" alt="" height="481" width="660"></p>
<p>OK YAY! we are ready to finally test, Test your map with the Test  
document button (or hit ctrl F9) and your game should run, yeah the  
camera doesnt look at Marinie right away so go find him and click him  
and check out his weapon and name</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-469" title="20geemv" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Creating%20your%20first%20unit%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/20geemv-e1277349328163.png" alt="" height="511" width="660"></p>
<p>Alright now move up some to find those grunt rines</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-478" title="npquqc" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Creating%20your%20first%20unit%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/npquqc-e1277349384453.png" alt="" height="511" width="660"></p>
<p>Now just unleash fury!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-468" title="9fvexe" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Creating%20your%20first%20unit%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/9fvexe-e1277349432681.png" alt="" height="511" width="660"></p>
<p>So Now you should know the basics behind making a unit and editing 
it.  Hopefully this can help you see how to go about editing other 
aspects of  the unit and creating more unique ones!</p>

<p>The Void Ray is a powerful unit that you can get very quickly in the 
 game. In most games if you’re able to quickly tech to void rays the  
chances of your opponent having enough anti-air to defend you is slim,  
although this is all based on having a good timing build. Once you have a
  Void Ray you must know how to micro the Void Ray so that you can stay 
 alive as you continue to macro and send in additional Void Rays or  
reinforcements.</p>

<h2>Void Ray Rush Build Order</h2>
<p>In order to be successful at a Void Ray rush you need to get the Void
 Rays out in the shortest amount of time possible, this is where 
practice and knowing the build order will help.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-732" title="VoidRayRush" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Void%20Ray%20Rush%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/VoidRayRush1.jpg" alt="" height="202" width="660"></p>
<p><strong>10/10 supply </strong>- Build a Pylon</p>
<p><strong>10/18&nbsp; supply</strong> -- Build a Gateway</p>
<p><strong>10/18 supply</strong> -- Build an Assimilator, as soon as the Assimilator is finished put 3 Probes harvesting Gas</p>
<p><strong>10/18 supply</strong> -- Send a Probe to scout unit’s location if on 2v2 Map.</p>
<p><strong>13/18 supply</strong> -- As soon as the Gateway is finished make Cybernetics Core</p>
<p><strong>14/18 supply</strong> -- As soon as Cybernetics Core is finished build Starport</p>
<p>Once your Starport is finished, immediately start building your first
  Void Ray; set the rally point &nbsp;to your opponent’s base. Make sure
 that  you use Chrono Boost on your Starport while your Void Ray is in  
production. If you are looking to take out their main base, then you  
will want to wait till you get 2 — 3 Void Rays so that you can fly  
right into your opponents base, and take it out.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Keeping it hidden</h2>
<p>The key to a successful void ray rush is to not let your opponent 
know that you are quickly teching to Void Rays, as a good player will be
 able to easily counter the rush if they know it’s coming.</p>
<p>When are building for a Void Ray rush it is a good idea to wall off 
your base so your opponent cannot get in and scout. When you are 
building for a Void Ray rush, it is a good idea to wall off  your base, 
making it impossible for your opponent to get in and scout.  You can do 
this by walling off your entrance with 2 Gateways and then  upgrading 
them to Warp gates later in the game to make ground units, or  do the 
more traditional Protoss wall off, which can be found in our <a href="http://shokzguide.com/members/protoss-guides/protoss-base-wall-off/">Protoss Wall off guide</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-731" title="HiddenStargate" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Void%20Ray%20Rush%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/HiddenStargate.jpg" alt="" height="242" width="660"></p>
<p>However, &nbsp;make sure you get a stalker or two &nbsp;when you wall
 off you so  they can shoot over your ramp wall and defend against any 
early rushes.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Proxy Stargate</h2>
<p>Another strategy to use when doing a Void Ray rush is to build a 
proxy  pylon &nbsp;and Stargate outside of your base closer to your 
opponents base,  but hidden in a corner. The reason for this is that if 
he scouts you, he  will not see your Stargate and will not expect the 
Void Ray rush. It  will also &nbsp;shorten the travel time from your 
Stargate to your opponents  base.<br>
When doing this you want to build your base normally, because if/when  
your opponent scouts you, if he were to see your base built up  
unusually, then he might expect a proxy base which would lead to him  
scouting the map for one…so try to keep to your normal base build and  
macro.</p>

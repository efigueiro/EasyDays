<p>A Build Order is the order in  which you construct your buildings,  
units, or research upgrades. Build  orders are often numbered by the  
supply count at which something is  built, but can also simply be based 
 in chronological order. For example,  a “10 gate” is a gateway made 
when  you have 10 probes. This could be  followed up with a cybernetics 
core  “immediately afterward”, meaning as  soon as the gateway is 
completed,  but at no particular supply count.</p>
<p>This is just the start and I will be adding a lot more build orders each day.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Standard Protoss 2 Gateway Build Order</h2>
<p>9/10 -&gt; Build a Pylon</p>
<p>13/18 -&gt; Build your first Gateway</p>
<p>14/18 -&gt; Build a Assimilator, once it is finished put 3 probes harvesting gas</p>
<p>15/18 -&gt; Build a Pylon</p>
<p>18/26 -&gt; Build a Cybernetics Core</p>
<p>18/26 -&gt; Build a Assimilator, once it is finished put 3 probes harvesting gas</p>
<p>20/26 -&gt; Build your second Gateway</p>
<p>21/26 -&gt; Research Warpgate Technology from the Cybernetics core</p>
<hr>
<h2>Standard Zealots into Stalker Build Order</h2>
<p>8/10 -&gt; Build a Paylon</p>
<p>10/18 -&gt;Send out probe to scout your opponent</p>
<p>12/18 -&gt; Bulid a Gateway</p>
<p>14/18 -&gt; Build a&nbsp; Assimilator, once finished add 3 probes to gas</p>
<p>14/18 -&gt; Build a Pylon</p>
<p>15/26 -&gt; Build a Cybernetics core</p>
<p>17/26 -&gt; Build your Second Gateway</p>
<p>18/26 -&gt; Build a Pylon</p>
<p>You don’t want to straight tech to Stalkers, you’ll want 3-4 zealots 
 out  first before you start pumping them just in case of early rush.</p>
<p>After your cybernetics core is finished and start producing stalkers,
 once you you have a couple Stalkers / Zealots move in for the quick 
attack.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Void Ray Rush Build Order</h2>
<p>10/10<strong> </strong>-&gt; Build a Pylon</p>
<p>10/18<strong> -&gt;</strong> Build a Gateway</p>
<p>10/18 -&gt; Build an Assimilator, as soon as the Assimilator is finished put 3 Probes harvesting Gas</p>
<p>10/18 -&gt; &nbsp; Send a Probe to scout unit’s location if on 2v2 Map.</p>
<p>13/18 -&gt;&nbsp; As soon as the Gateway is finished make Cybernetics Core</p>
<p>14/18 -&gt; As soon as Cybernetics Core is finished build Starport</p>
<p>Once your Starport is finished, immediately start building your first
   Void Ray; set the rally point &nbsp;to your opponent’s base. Make 
sure that   you use Chrono Boost on your Starport while your Void Ray is
 in   production. If you are looking to take out their main base, then 
you   will want to wait till you get 2 — 3 Void Rays so that you can fly
   right into your opponents base, and take it out.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Gateway + Forge Fast Expand Build Order</h2>
<p>The gate+forge fast expand is a very strong and common build that 
isn’t  covered by the 2 gate template. The general idea in a gate+forge 
fast  expand is to build your first pylon, gate way, and forge by the 
choke  into your natural, to protect yourself from early rushes, build a
 cannon  or two, and then expand.</p>
<p>9/10 -&gt; Build a Pylon</p>
<p>13/18 -&gt; Build a Gateway</p>
<p>15/18 -&gt; Build a Forge</p>
<p>15 /18 -&gt; Build a Pylon</p>
<p>Produce any some zealots / cannons if needed</p>
<p>18+ Build a Nexus at your natural expansion</p>
<p>You will also want to use the early zealots to put on any kind of  
pressure you can, but being careful to not be overly aggressive and lose
  zealots unnecessarily.</p>

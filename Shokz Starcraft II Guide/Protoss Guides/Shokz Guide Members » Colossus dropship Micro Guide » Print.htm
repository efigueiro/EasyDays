					<div id="BlogContent"><p><img class="size-full wp-image-17 alignnone" title="ProtossGuide" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Colossus%20dropship%20Micro%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/ProtossGuide.jpg" alt="" height="148" width="660"></p>
<p>The Colossus is a great Protoss unit that is generally the backup 
force of your army and will stand behind your zealots, stalkers and 
immortals, but when you want to get creative your able to be very 
effective with a Colossus dropship harass either on the opponents army 
or on their minerals lines.</p>
<h2>Getting Prepared</h2>
<p>To do the Colossus dropship harass you are going to need Colossus of 
course, and a Warp Prism, both of these are built from a Robotics Bay so
 I generally will get atleast 2 Robotics bays and Chrono boost both the 
Colossus and Warp Prism to get them out ASAP. Once you have your 
Colossus and Warp Prism make sure to hot key them both so you can 
quickly access them while in battle or when you are harassing.</p>
<p>Note: Research the Colossus Range Upgrade</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-339" title="ColossusPrism" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Colossus%20dropship%20Micro%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/ColossusPrism.jpg" alt="" height="221" width="596"></p>
<p>This Colossus harass is not going to be enough to destroy your 
enemies base, but if done correctly it can turn the game in your favor 
so you still need to produce units. Since you already have a Robotics 
Bay I would go with a heavy Stalker, Immortal build with a few Colossus 
to to back them up. That way once your done harassing them you’ll be 
able to finish them up with your actual army.</p>

<h2>Colossus Harassment</h2>
<p>Once you are ready load a Colossus into your Warp Prism and make your
 way to the back of your opponents base, make sure you have a clear path
 to the base since Warp Prism go down easily when under fire. Unload 
your Colossus behind the mineral line and let him go to town on the 
workers, once you see your opponent start to bring his units to defend 
his minerals load your Colossus in your Warp Prism and fly out. Continue
 to do do this while you build a decent attack force in your base.</p>

<p>Once you are ready to attack take your army to his base and engage 
him, he will bring all his forces to defend against your attack and this
 is when you can go drop your Colossus behind his minerals once again. 
Most players will focus on the main attack in the front of his base and 
you’ll be able to take out all his workers and possibly even his main 
base.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Using the High Ground</h2>
<p>On a lot of maps your minerals are next to a high or low ground where
 you can move your Colossus up and down from, if the map your own has 
this use this to your advantage when attacking and micro your Colossus 
up and down off the cliff keeping him out of range of attack while 
keeping the pressure on him.</p>

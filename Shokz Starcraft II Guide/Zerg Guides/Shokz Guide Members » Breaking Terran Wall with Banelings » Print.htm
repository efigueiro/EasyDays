					<div id="BlogContent"><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19" title="ZergGuide" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Breaking%20Terran%20Wall%20with%20Banelings%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/ZergGuide.jpg" alt="" height="148" width="660"></p>
<p>When playing against Terran players they will almost always wall 
off&nbsp; their base with units behind their wall to protect against 
speedling rushes. This makes it very difficult to rush to do a speedling
 rush against a Terran player as just zerglings wont’ be able to break 
through their wall if they use SCVs to repair their Supply Depots. This 
is where banglings come in which will allow you to break down the Terran
 wall and give you an open passage to send your speedlings into your 
opponents base.</p>

<h2>Build Order</h2>
<p>9 -- Overlord</p>
<p>12 -- Extractor</p>
<p>12 -- Spawning Pool</p>
<p>When going for the Banling Wall build you want to do a normal build 
but with a 10 or 12 spawning pool, the key is getting your gas before or
 the same time as your spawning pool since this is a gas heavy build and
 will need a lot of gas as quickly has possible. Once your extractor 
finishes make sure to put 3 drones gathering gas and start building a 
queen the moment your spawning pool is complete.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-342" title="BanlingNest" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Breaking%20Terran%20Wall%20with%20Banelings%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/BanlingNest.jpg" alt="" height="214" width="596"></p>
<p>Once you have your queen cast Spawn Larva on your hatchery and start 
your zergling speed upgrade, along with a Banlings Nest. As your 
zergling upgrade is being trained and your banlings nest is being built 
continue to build zerglings so that you are ready to attack once the 
upgrade finishes.</p>

<h2>Breaking down the Wall</h2>
<p>Once the zergling speed upgrade is finished and your banlings nest is
 ready move your speedlings out on the map close to your opponents base.
 Make sure your back far enough from his base where he won’t see you and
 morph 4 -5 zerglings into banlings.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-291" title="BanlingRollRamp" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Breaking%20Terran%20Wall%20with%20Banelings%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/BanlingRollRamp.jpg" alt="" height="266" width="596"></p>
<p>Take a speedling and run up your opponents ramp to see his wall 
layout and then bring it back down. Set your Speedlings to a 1 control 
group and your Banlings to another control group so you can quickly 
access them. When you are ready take your Banlings and run them up the 
ramp into a Supply Depot to break down the wall.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-290" title="BanlingExplode" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Breaking%20Terran%20Wall%20with%20Banelings%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/BanlingExplode.jpg" alt="" height="235" width="596"></p>
<p>Once you’ve breached the wall quickly grab your Speedlings and rush 
them up into his base and take out his units and then head straight for 
his workers. If you have any additional Banlings left run them into his 
marines or marauders to quickly dispose of them as your Speedlings are 
running into his base. Continue to produce Zerglings while you are 
attacking and set the rally point to your opponents base so you have 
reinforcements on the way.</p>

<h2>If you don’t win</h2>
<p>Sometimes you’ll run across a player who is well prepared and can 
actually survive the Banling, Speedling attack. If your attack is 
unsuccessful and you don’t win the game from the attack then tech 
straight into Hdyras. Right before you attack it is a good idea to 
upgrade your Hatchery to a Liar so by the time your done attacking you 
can quickly build a hydralisk den and transition into normal macro mode.</p>

					<div id="BlogContent"><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19" title="ZergGuide" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Zerg%20Queen%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/ZergGuide.jpg" alt="" height="148" width="660"></p>
<h2>The Queen</h2>
<p>The Queen is one of the most important units of the Zerg. The Queen 
controls your base and your economy and is the key to have great Macro 
as a Zerg player. The Queen also serves as an early game base defense 
and can help hold off rushes at the start of the game, but overall the 
queen will help you control the game’s tempo and the map.</p>
<p>The Queen is made from your hatchery, once you have a spawning pool 
and should be made immediately after your spawning pool is finished in 
every game. The queen has 3 very important abilities which is what makes
 them so important to every Zerg player. The abilities of Spawn Larva, 
Spawn Creep Tumor and Transfusion makes the queen arguably the most 
important support unit in the game.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-277" title="ZergQueen" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Zerg%20Queen%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/ZergQueen.jpg" alt="" height="219" width="596"></p>
<p>Since the Queen is such an important unit for the Zerg I always set 
the Queen to a Control Group so I can quickly access here at all times. 
My preferecne is to set my main Hatchery to “5″ and then set my queen to
 “4″.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Spawn Larva</h2>
<p>The Spawn larva (V) ability is casted on your hatchery and spawns 4 
extra larva and takes 40 seconds. This is by far the most useful ability
 of your queen and is crucial to always keep it casted on your hatchery.
 The reason for doing so is that your hatchery only produces a maximum 
of 3 larva at one time and the extra 4 is crucial to continue to produce
 drones and units at a high rate.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-274" title="SpawnLarvaQueen" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Zerg%20Queen%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/SpawnLarvaQueen.jpg" alt="" height="198" width="596"></p>
<p>When your queen first created the very first thing you should do in 
every game is cast the Spawn larva skill on you hatchery, you then want 
to set your queen to a control group so while you are controlling your 
army you can quickly double tap the queen’s control group to access her 
and cast Spawn larva on your hatchery. You want to make sure you keep 
this up while in battle as you will need the extra larva to continue to 
produce units at a high rate so you can keep sending them into battle.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Spawn Creep Tumor</h2>
<p>Spawn Creep Tumor (C) allows the Queen to place a creep tumor 
anywhere on creep which will then spawn additional creep around the 
creep tumor. Creep Tumors are a very important part of the Zerg because 
creep allows your units to move 30% faster while on the creep and will 
give you an advantage during combat.</p>
<p>Once you have a creep tumor down you are then able to cast another 
creep tumor from the original creep tumor and start to build a creep 
highway to your enemies base which will help to get reinforcements to 
your army quicker.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-275" title="ZergCreepTumorQueen" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Zerg%20Queen%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/ZergCreepTumorQueen.jpg" alt="" height="209" width="596"></p>
<p>On any map when you expand to your natural expansion&nbsp; the creep 
of both your hatchery will not connect, this is where extending the 
creep is crucial as it will allow you to defend your expansion and main 
base easier and allow your queen to quickly move from your expansion to 
main.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Transfusion</h2>
<p>Transfusion is the Queen’s healing ability, this is very useful if 
your opponent does a lot of damage to your hatchery and you need to heal
 it, or if you are rushed you can use this to heal your units while 
defending the rush.</p>
<p><strong>Queen Tips</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Build 1 queen for every expansion, so you can continue to produce extra larva from them.</li>
<li>If an opponent quickly goes quick air and you don’t have any AA, build a few queens to defend against.</li>
<li>Use Spawn Larva as much as possible.</li>
<li>Queens move very slowly off creep so use creep tumors to connect expansion.</li>
</ul>

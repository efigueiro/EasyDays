<p>Zerglings with  the speed upgrade “Metabolic Boost” are commonly 
referred to as  Speedlings. They are a unit which I use every time I 
play as Zerg and  they are effective at all levels of the game and are 
one of the funniest  units to play with.</p>
<p>The reason for  going Speedlings every game I play Zerg is they are a
 great to defend  your base and can be used to harass your opponents 
minerals giving your  the economic edge and in most cases win you the 
game.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Speedling Build  Order</h2>
<p>10 – Spawning  Pool</p>
<p>10 – Extractor</p>
<p>10 – Overlord</p>
<p>13 – Queen</p>
<p>When start the game you want to build drones till you reach 10 
supply, once your at 10 supply save 200 minerals for a Spawning Pool. 
Once you started the Spawning pool you need to start an extractor right 
away and place 3 drones on gas once its finished becaues you will need 
100 gas for the Metabolic Boost once your spawning pool is finished.</p>
<p>Right when your Spawning Pool finishes build a queen and then get the
 Metabolic Boost as soon as you have 100 Minerals &amp; 100 Gas.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Preparing the Attack</h2>
<p><strong>Keep up Production</strong> – Before you attack make sure you
 hot key your hatchery hot keyed so  you can continue to produce 
Zerglings during the attack along with your  Queen so you can cast 
“Spawn Larva” on your hatchery to keep your unit  production high.</p>

<p><strong>Split Groups </strong>– I  always split my Zerglings into two
 control groups which will allow me to micro them easier if I want to do
 a split attack or use one group as a diversion which I will explain 
shortly.</p>
<hr>
<h2>General Attack Strategies</h2>
<p>When you are ready to attack take your units to the entrance of your 
opponents base, than take a single Zergling and run it into their base 
to see layout and the units they have. How you attack is going to depend
 on if you think you can defeat their army or if you just want to harass
 their minerals.</p>
<p><strong>Attacking the Army </strong>- If they have a small army and 
you can take them out with your Zerglings then run unto their base and 
fight them in the open so you can gain a surround on their units. Make 
sure to fight them away from any static defense they have and way from 
any choke points so that your Zerglings can get a surround on them.</p>
<p><strong>Going for the Minerals</strong> – If your opponent built for a
 rush and has a good size army which your Zerglings wouldn’t be able to 
take out then you need to focus on causing economic damage. Try to draw 
your opponents army out of their base, than run past them right into 
their mineral lines and let your Speedlings start attacking their 
workers. Once he brings his forces as backup run your Speedlings out of 
their and run them around his base keeping them away from his army and 
then dash back into on the minerals.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-369" title="ZerglingsInTerranMinerals" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Speedling%20Rush%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/ZerglingsInTerranMinerals-e1276617779315.jpg" alt="" height="239" width="660"></p>
<p><strong>Split Attack </strong>- Before I attack I always split my 
Speedlings into 3 Control Groups, 1 group selects all the Speedlings, 
the 2nd selects 1 half while the 3rd control group selects the second 
half of the Speedlings. The Reason I do this is that it will allow me to
 easily surround my opponents forces since I can have one group hit from
 the front and then flank the other group around and attack from the 
back.</p>
<p>You can also use the two groups as a diversion, if your opponent is 
sitting on his ramp you can use one group to draw his forces out of his 
base while you take your other group and run them into the back of his 
base to attack his resources.</p>
<p><strong>Chasing them down </strong>- Speedlings are the fastest 
ground units in Starcraft 2, you can use this to your advantage to chase
 down scouts, or units retreating from a failed attack. When chasing 
down a unit run your Speedlings in front of the unit so they can then 
surround them and stop their movement. You don’t want to just chase the 
unit attacking from behind because the unit will continue to move 
compared to if you surround him he won’t be able to keep moving and go 
down quickly.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Attacking Protoss</h2>
<p>A lot of Protoss players will not wall off their base and if they do 
they will not do so correctly, this will allow you to run right past any
 zealots or stalkers they have into their mineral line and start taking 
out workers. This should be your first priority when hitting Protoss 
players.</p>
<p>If you see that you heavily out number the Protoss Units you should 
go directly at them and take them out. You want to get a surround on 
zealots and stalkers to take them out quickly and not let them get 
cornered against a wall or building where you cannot surround them so 
don’t engage until they are out in the open.</p>
<p>Once you’ve killed his units talk a look at how his gateways are 
setup, if there is only one pylon or two powering the gateways try to 
take them out first. If your able to powerdown his gateways you’ve 
pretty much won the game as long as you keep producing Speedlings and 
sending them into his base to finish off his probes.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Attacking Terran</h2>
<p>Terran almost always wall off their base and put a few marines or 
marauders behind their wall, this makes it almost impossible to break 
through the wall with just Speedlings.</p>
<p>When a you see that Terran is walling off their base you have two 
options, one is to go for a Banling wall break and then run your 
speedlings into his base which is discussed in further detail in our 
Banling Terran Wall Break Guide. Or you can quickly create a few roaches
 and use them to focus fire down a Supply Depot in the Terran wall and 
then run your zerglings into the Terran base.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Attacking Zerg</h2>
<p>Speedling rushes against Zerg players is an interesting match up. How
 you play this will be dependent on if your opponent is going Speedlings
 as well or if they go for a tech based build and get Roaches and 
Hydras. In all situations when going against Zerg you should try to 
surround your opponents Queen and take her out first since she is the 
key to their economy. By doing this it will slow down their unit 
production since they won’t be able to cast “Spawn Larva” until they 
produce a new Queen.</p>
<h3>Against Speedlings</h3>
<p>If your opponent goes Speedlings you need out number him by producing
 more Speedlings then he has. Do not fight him next to his hatchery 
since he will have his queen as backup although if your able to quickly 
run in and take out his Queen then do so. This will allow you to produce
 more Speedlings at a faster rate if your able to take out his queen.</p>
<p>If he is doing an all in Speedling rush then build a Banelings nest 
and produce a few Banelings. Then when you attack bring in your 
Banelings in and you’ll be able to take out a large amount of his 
Speedlings with just a few Banelings giving you the advantage.</p>
<h3>Against Macro Zerg</h3>
<p>When a Zerg player is looking to Macro they will usually expand early
 with a 15 or 18 hatchery and go into a Roach or Hydra build. When they 
do this they will get a few Zerglings out to protect their base and 
maybe put some pressure on you, but by going straight Speedlings as long
 as you don’t wait to long to attack you should be able to take them out
 easily.</p>
<p>The key is to attack before they can build an army of Roaches or 
Hydralisk. A lot of players will build a spine crawler in their base for
 defense as they try to macro although you can pull his units out of his
 base and fight them out of range of his defense once you take them out 
you’ll be able to move in on his defense and queen.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Transition out  of Speedlings</h2>
<p>There are times when your Speedlings just didn’t work or you were 
able to do economic damage to your opponent, but need higher tier units 
to finish them off. Knowing how to transition into other units from a 
Speedling Rush is very important and doing so will help you finish off 
the game after your initial rush.</p>
<p><strong>Start during the Rush</strong> – When you are rushing with 
your Speedlings and you see that you have extra resources use this to 
upgrade your Hatchery into a Lair. This is very important because a Liar
 is needed to create Hydralisk and Mutalisk which is two of the common 
transitional units from Speedlings . If you wait until after the rush to
 upgrade your Hatchery you will be stuck siting around waiting for your 
Liar to finish instead of producing new units. A lot of times I’ll even 
upgrade my Hatchery into Liar right before I go in for the first attack 
so by the time I”m done attacking I can then move on to tier 2 units.</p>
<p><strong>Hydras</strong> – Producing Hydras after Speedlings is a 
normal transition and the one I use most often, the Hydras provide good 
anti air along with great ground support and with a group of Speedlings 
can quickly dispatch most builds.</p>
<p><strong>Mutalisks</strong> – If you notice during the rush your 
opponent doesn’t have much anti air or isn’t close to getting any then 
you want to quickly build a Spire and start producing Mutaslisks . If 
you can get a couple of Mutalisks out before your opponent has any real 
anit air you’ll be able to pick off their workers and destroy their 
economy.</p>

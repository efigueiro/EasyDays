<p>Creep is the one main thing that sets Zerg apart from the other 
races. Creep is the organic ground that serves as the nourisment and 
lifeblood of the Zerg structures and buildings and has a distinct 
advantage to Zerg players when used correctly.</p>
<h2>Features of Creep</h2>
<p>All Zerg buildings must be built on Creep, the exception to this rule
 is a Hatchery which can be built anywhere as this is needed to expand. 
While this may bee seen as a downfall it actually isn’t bad as Creep 
gives you a lot of benefits and using Creep to your advantage is crucial
 in each game.</p>
<p>Other races cannot build on Creep, this will prevent other races from
 building a bunker or proxy pylon right next to your hatchery, although 
other Zerg players can build on your creep and you can build on theirs.</p>
<p>Grants 30% movement speed bonus to all Zerg units. This is most 
beneficial part of creep, this is why players try to expand creep as 
much as possible along the map so their units can move along the map at a
 quicker rate. When you have a large portion of the map covered in creep
 the extra 30% bonus speed will allow you to defend your base against 
rushes easier, reinforce your army quicker, and escape from battles 
which you are out numbered or don’t have an advantage.</p>

<h2>Spreading Creep</h2>
<h3>Creep Tumor</h3>
<p>Since spreading creep along the map is so important for Zerg, knowing
 how to do it effectively is just as important. The most effective way 
to spread creep is by a Creep Tumor.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-275 blogimage" title="ZergCreepTumorQueen" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Zerg%20Creep%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/ZergCreepTumorQueen.jpg" alt="" height="209" width="596"></p>
<p>A Creep Tumor is casted by your Queen and is casted on existing creep
 and will generate creep growth around the creep tumor. You can then 
cast an additional Creep tumor from your original creep tumor to keep 
growing creep along the map and this process can be repeated creep tumor
 to creep tumor. Creep tumors are also cloaked, but can be killed if 
your opponent has a detector near the Creep Tumor.</p>
<h3>Overlord Creep Generation</h3>
<p>The second way to spreed Creep is from an Overlord, once you upgrade 
your Hatchery to a Liar all your overlords get the ability to generate 
Creep. This ability will allow the overlord to spill creep down on the 
ground in a single area, although the overlord must remain their or the 
creep will disappear.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-292 blogimage" title="CreepExpansionBlock" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Zerg%20Creep%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/CreepExpansionBlock.jpg" alt="" height="252" width="596"></p>
<p>Besides spreading your overlords over the map and creating a Creep 
highway to your enemies base you can use the generate creep feature to 
spill creep on all the expansion along the map which will prevent your 
opponent from expanding since they will not be able to build on the 
Creep.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Creep Highway</h2>
<p>A Creep Highway is refereed to when a player creates a road of Creep 
from his base to his opponent. The reason to do this is that it will 
allow you to quickly move units from your base to your opponents along 
with allow you to send reinforcements to your army quicker when you are 
attacking your opponent.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-293 blogimage" title="CreepHighway" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Zerg%20Creep%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/CreepHighway.jpg" alt="" height="231" width="596"></p>
<p>Along with giving your units a road of creep to follow you are also 
giving yourself view of the entire map and the pathway to your base. 
This will let you know if and when your opponent is going to make a move
 to expand or to attack you. Where every you have a creep tumor along 
your Creep highway you will have sight of that area.</p>

<h2>Creep Video</h2>
<p>In the video below the zerg player uses the creep to his advantage to
 create a creep highway to use while he attacks his opponent.</p>

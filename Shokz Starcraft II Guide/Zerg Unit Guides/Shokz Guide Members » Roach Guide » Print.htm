<p>Roach is strong armored early game unit which can be very hard to 
deal with in quick rushes. These powerful units are hard to take out, 
but their extra armor can be a downfall if you go against units such as 
Immortals that do extra damage against armored units. In most games 
roaches are great to mix with Zerglings or Hydralisks as they provide a 
good balance with both mixes and work well with almost any combination 
that your opponent will have in a early to mid game attack.</p>

<h2>Skills and Strategies</h2>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-852" title="tunneling_claws" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Roach%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/tunneling_claws.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Tunneling Claws</strong>:
 Trained from the Roach Warren it enables the Roach to move while 
burrowed. While burrowed, the Roach also has increased health 
regeneration. This can be used to tunnel your roaches underground to 
your opponents minerals pop up and take out his workers, although this 
becomes more difficult as you get higher up in leagues. The Ability to 
burrow though is a great way to flee from a battle because not only will
 you be able to get your roaches away from a losing battle with out 
being killed you will regen health while doing so.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-850" title="glial_reconstitution" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Roach%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/glial_reconstitution.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Glial Reconstitution</strong>:
 This skill is also trained from the Roach Warren and it increases 
movement speed of your roaches. I don’t find my self using this to often
 since if I need upgraded speed for my units I will get it for my 
Zerglings or I use Creep Tumors to spreed creep across the map which 
increases the speed of all my units. If you plan on going an all in 
Roach Attack then use this upgrade will he helpful since it will allow 
your reinforcement Roaches to get to your army quicker.</p>
<p><strong>Roach/Zergling Combination</strong><br>
This is the earliest possible combination you can have in a game. The  
main idea for this is be treated as a watered down version of the  
Ultralisk/Zergling combination. The Roach’s role is lead the force head 
 on and take most of the damage first, then let the Zerglings charge in.
  In this case, the Roaches should try to create a distraction, because 
 they can absorb most of the damage by using their fast regeneration.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Against other Races</h2>
<p><strong>Vs Protoss</strong>: If your Protoss opponent is going for a 
loaded Zealot rush then Roaches are what you want! I would skip 
Zerglings all together when you see a Zealot rush and go straight for 
Roaches since they can counter them very easily, later in the rush if 
you see stalkers starting to appear then you can mix in a couple 
Zerglings and your Roach / Zergling build should be good, although once 
your opponent starts getting Immortals you need to transition out of 
roaches as Immortals do ridiculous damage against them.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Terran</strong>: Roaches are great against most of the 
Terran early units such as Marines, Repaers and Hellions although can be
 taken out quickly with Marauders and even quicker if the Marauders have
 Stim pack. If you see your opponent is massing marauders you can keep 
making a few Roaches, but get a Zergling heavy Roach / Zergling army and
 you will counter his mass Marauders. The same goes for Siege Tanks, 
they can take out a group of Roaches fast so building Zerlings to take 
out the Siege Tanks or Mutaliskks will be the best way to go.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Zerg</strong>: Just like with Zergling battles Roach wars 
will turn into who can produce the most and micro the best, or 
transition out of them, if your opponent continues to produce roaches 
you can slowly tech into Mutalisks which will give you the Arial 
advantage, just make sure you continue to produce enough roaches to 
defend your base or put enough Spine Crawlers down in defense so you can
 hold off any attack till you get Mutalisks.</p>

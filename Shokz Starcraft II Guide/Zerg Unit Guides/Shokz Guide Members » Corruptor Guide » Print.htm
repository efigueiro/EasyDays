<p>Corruptors are the Zerg’s main anti-air unit. They are very powerful 
against any air but they cannot attack ground units making the the main 
choice if your opponent starts to mass a force of air units. The other 
purpose of Corruptors is you can morph them into Brood Lords who are 
some of the most powerful units in the game and when combined with 
Corruptors make for a insane combination.</p>

<h2>Skills and Strategies</h2>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-892" title="corruption" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Corruptor%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/corruption.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Corruption</strong>:
 Covers a target in acid causing it to take more damage. This is a great
 skill although I don’t see it used very often, when you are attacking 
an opponents base with your forces this works great to cast on a couple 
buildings to quickly take down once you have take out your opponents 
air. This also works great if you ever want to run in and try to snipe 
out an opponent’s expansion. Just create one Corruptor with your ground 
forces and cast Corruption on their expansion focus fire it down and 
then run out of there.</p>

<h2>Against other Races</h2>
<p><strong>Vs Protoss</strong>: Corruptors along with Hdyralisks are the
 best defense against Void Rays if your opponent is massing them 
building a couple Corruptors will help easily dispose of them. The main 
use of Corruptors when playing against a Protoss player is when you see 
they are going Carriers, they are one of the only units that can 
effectively hold up against them and take them out.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Terran</strong>: When your opponent tries to Banshee rush 
you Corruptors are the quickest way expose of them, Hydralisks also work
 well but for a lot of players who are going into a Mutalisk tech then 
going Corruptors for even better anti-air then Mutalisks is a good way 
to go.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Zerg</strong>: The only reason to go Corruptors in a Zerg 
vs Zerg match up is to get Brood Lords late in the game or to counter 
Brood Lords. Brood Lords can be one of the most devastating units and 
with their long range can take ground units out quickly, but Corruptors 
can easily counter them and take them out of the sky with no problem and
 quicker then Mutalisks can.</p>

<p>Zerglings are small, fast, and quick units which work well in the 
masses, these units are the first Zerg attacking unit your able to build
 and with good Micro they can be used through out the entire game 
depending on your opponents build. The new pathing system also makes 
Zerglings much more aggressive in the  heat of battle because they 
surround their enemy much more easily now.  The downside to this is that
 units bunch together now, making Zerglings  much more susceptible to 
Siege Tank fire and other splash attacks.</p>

<h2>Skills and Strategies</h2>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-834" title="metabolic_boost" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Zergling%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/metabolic_boost.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Metabolic Boost</strong>:
 Increases the movement speed of all Zerglings by 20%, this is a must 
have upgrade if you plan on using a lot of Zerglings, once you have this
 upgrade Zerglings are now known as Speedlings since they have the speed
 upgrade. Once you have the speed upgrade Zerglings become the fastest 
units in the game and are able to quickly race across the map and harass
 your opponent, this works great in early game to run your Speedlings 
right past your opponents units into their mineral line and start taking
 out their gatherers.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-833" title="adrenal_glands" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Zergling%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/adrenal_glands.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Adrenal Glands</strong>:
 Increases the attack speed of all Zerglings by 20%, although requires a
 Hive. This is a great upgrade also but unlike Metabolic Boost where you
 can research right away, Adrenal Glands you must have a Hive before you
 can research this upgrade making it not available till late game. A lot
 of times if games go into the late game this is a good upgrade to get 
if you have the extra cash because you never know when you may need to 
pop out a bunch of Zerglings to counter a unit such as mass Thors in the
 late game.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://shokzguide.com/members/zerg-guides/speedling-rush-guide/">Speedling Rush Guide</a></li>
<li>Run your Zerglings past your opponents army into their minerals to harass their economy.</li>
<li>Use Zerglings to run around the map and check for opponent expansions.</li>
<li>Zerglings can be used through out the entire game, don’t just think you can only use them to rush</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Zergling/Hydralisk Combination:</strong><br>
The Zergling and Hydralisk are a force to be reckoned with. The  
Zergling’s main role in this type of attack is the primary fighting  
force against any ground units. Even though the Hydralisks are there for
  support, the Zerglings are also there for protecting the Hydralisks.  
Obviously the Zerglings should be in the lead of this attack.</p>
<p><strong>Zergling/Mutalisk Combination:</strong><br>
This is a much more versatile approach than the Hydralisks. The  
Mutalisks have more speed than the Hydralisks, and the Zerglings have  
much more space to move about. The Zerglings main role is attacking the 
 ground units again, but there are different variations that can occur, 
 since the Mutalisk is an air unit.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Against other Races:</h2>
<p><strong>Vs Protoss</strong>: If you rush a Protoss player with 
Zerglings and they don’t wall off their base with a Gateway / Zealot 
then you should try to run right past their entrance and into their 
mineral field, if your able to get back there and start taking out 
Probes then you will be in great shape and can try to continue to send 
more units and win the game. Zerglings are very strong against stalkers 
if the can surround them which will allow you to quickly take out his 
army in a rush if he teched straight to Stalkers.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Terran</strong>: It is almost impossible to Zerling rush 
Terran players since they almost always / should wall off their base 
with a Barracks and Supply Depot. The one thing you can do to get past 
the wall off is to use Banelings to break down the wall and then run 
into his base with your Zerglings, for more info check out the <a href="http://shokzguide.com/members/zerg-guides/breaking-terran-wall-with-banelings/">Baneling Bust Guide</a>.
 Although outside of the Terran’s base Zerglings are a strong counter to
 mass Marauders and are great against Thors, if you can get a surround 
on a Thor you can take him down extremely quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Zerg</strong>: Zergling vs Zergling rush matches are fun 
as it comes down to who can micro the best, if you are stuck in a 
Zergling rush match with another Zerg player a good idea would be to get
 a couple Banelings, if you can get them to explode on their Zerglings 
you can easily overwhelm him and usually take him out. The main thing 
you need to watch out for is a tech to Roaches because as soon as your 
opponent get’s roaches you need to fall out of Zerglings and start going
 a different route such as Roaches yourself or Hydras into Mutalisks.</p>

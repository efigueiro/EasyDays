<p>Banelings are suicidal units that explode and do a huge amount of 
splash damage, they are great against clusters of units such as Marine /
 Marauders, zealots and Stalkers / or Hydras and Zerlings. Banelings are
 made by morphing Zerglings into Banelings and require a Banelings nest 
which allows your opponent to see that you are going Banelings with 
early scouting.</p>

<h2>Skills and Strategies</h2>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-838" title="centrifugal_hooks" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Baneling%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/centrifugal_hooks.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Centrifugal Hooks</strong>:
 This upgrade from the Banelings nest increases the Banelings movement 
speed which is very helpful when doing a Baneling rush since your 
opponent won’t have enough time to focus fire your Banelings before the 
reach him.</p>

<li><a href="http://shokzguide.com/members/zerg-guides/breaking-terran-wall-with-banelings/">Breaking Terran Wall with Baneling Guide</a></li>
<li>Banelings have the ability to explode while burrowed, this allows 
you to place Banelings in strategic areas and wait for your opponent to 
walk over them and then have them explode on your opponent.</li>
<li>If you can get a couple of Banelings into your opponents mineral 
line they will be able to explode taking out most of their workers.</li>
<li>You can do a Baneling drop on your opponents army by filling up a 
couple Overlords with Banelings and droping them on your opponent when 
you engage him in battle.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Against other Races</h2>
<p><strong>Vs Protoss</strong>: Banelings work well if your opponent is 
Zealot rushing you or massing Zealots later in the game, although they 
are not very strong against many other Protoss units since they can 
focus fire the Banelings before you get to them. If your able to do a 
Baneling Drop on the Probes you’ll really harm his economy although you 
must first tech to a Liar in order to get Overlord transport.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Terran</strong>:Banelings work great against Marine / 
Marauder balls if you can get a couple of Banelings to explode on a 
tightly packed group of Marines and Marauders you should easily be able 
to finish them off with the rest of your forces. Banelings are also very
 important against Terran if you plan on doing a Zergling rush as you 
will to use Banelings to break the Terran wall to rush in your Zerglings</p>
<p><strong>Vs Zerg</strong>: A lot of times in Zerg matches early rushes
 will turn into Zergling micro wars all about who can produce the most 
Zerglings and Micro them the best to win, but by tossing a few Banelings
 into the mix your able to try and take out large groups of Zerglings 
giving you the advantage. Banelings also work well later in the game 
against Hydralisks, but should be avoided if your opponent is massing 
Roaches.</p>

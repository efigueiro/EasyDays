<p>Mutalisks are Zergs most balanced air unit with the ability to attack
 both air and land. Each time a Mutalisks attack it will bounce to 2 
additonal targets dealing a 3rd of the damage than the previous hit. 
They Mutalisks speed makes it one of the best harassing units in the 
game and if your able to get them quick you can catch your opponent off 
guard with a Mutalisk rush and win the game or severely damage his 
economy.</p>
<h2>Against other Race</h2>
<p><strong>Vs Protoss</strong>: Stalkers are a very strong counter to 
Mutalisks, and Stalkers are in most Protoss player builds which means 
that you need to use Mutalisks more as a harassing unit against most 
Protoss players by attacking their minerals and flying away once their 
forces come to defend. If your opponent masses stalkers once he sees 
that you are going Mutalisks you can build a Zerglings with a 
combination of Mutalisks to take out the Stalkers.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Terran</strong>: Against a player who is pushing a heavy 
Marauder build teching into Mutalisks is a great counter to mass 
Marauders. Terran has a lot of good anti-air defense in their arsenal, 
first off Turrets are very powerful against Mutalisks and unless you 
have a group of Mutalisks and there is only 1 or two Turrets I would 
stay away from them. Marines are also a good counter to Mutalisks but 
cannot win a game with just mass marines, so make sure you continue 
producing Zerglings so it will force your opponent to spend money on 
Hellions to counter the Zerlings.</p>
<p>When going against Thors you want to make sure you spread your 
mutalisks out, Thors do splash damage and if you keep your Mutalisks 
close together they will be able to do extra damage with Splash. When 
you are attacking Thor or two with Muta’s spread them out to limit the 
damage each one takes and you’ll be able to take them out.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Zerg</strong>: Mutalisks are good against Zerg if you can 
get them out before they can tech to Hydralisks, once they are able to 
produce Hydralisks they can counter the Mutalisks pretty easily, 
although that doesn’t mean you still can’t use them against Hydralisks, 
by creating a couple of Mutalisks but still doing your normal build 
against Hydralisks you can use your Mutalisks to attack his base while 
you engage in battle with your opponent.</p>

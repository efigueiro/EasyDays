<p>Hydralisks is the Zerg’s first real anti-air unit and an all around 
good unit that can hold it’s own on the ground and defend against air 
attacks well. Hydras are not as strong as they use to be in the original
 Starcraft and work better in a mixture of units than just massing them.
 A good combination is going straight from a Zergling rush into 
Hydralisks while still producing Zerglings or into a Roach / Hydra build
 which works well as the Roaches provide the meat up front while the 
Hydralisks can attack from behind the roaches.</p>

<h2>Skills and Strategies</h2>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-857" title="grooved_spines" src="Shokz%20Guide%20Members%20%C2%BB%20Hydralisk%20Guide%20%C2%BB%20Print_files/grooved_spines.gif" alt="" height="62" width="62">Grooved Spines</strong>:
 This is upgraded from the Hydralisk Den and increases the Hydralisks 
attack range, this is a great upgrade if you are going to go any type of
 Hydralisks build, it will help against air since your Hydralisks can 
attack from farther away and also in battle.</p>
<ul class="clear">
<li>Hydralisks are a great support unit and work well with almost any Zerg combination of units.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Hydralisk/Zergling Combination</strong><br>
The Hydralisk’s primary role within this combo is for early air-tech  
support. If this does not apply, then the Hydralisk will be there for  
general support. The Hydralisk should be at the back of this force while
  the Zerglings go in for close combat. It is suggested that you upgrade
  the Hydralisk speed and carapace, because the Zergling and Hydralisk  
share this upgrade.</p>
<p><strong>Hydralisk/Roach Combination</strong><br>
Like the Zergling combo, the Hydralisk will accompany the Roaches in  
case your opponent decides to fast tech to air. Depending on how you use
  your Roaches, that Hydralisks might be included in more combat than  
just support for the Roaches.</p>
<p><strong>Hydralisk/Mutalisk Combination</strong><br>
This possibly the most flexible combo within the Zerg ****nal. Both the 
 Hydralisk and Mutalisk can both rely on each other for support. Your  
Hydralisks might take the majority of the damage depending on whether  
you micro the Mutalisks or not. It is suggested that you upgrade  
Hydralisk speed, but you may have to pool more time into upgrading  
carapace or attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Hydralisk/Corruptor Combination</strong><br>
This combination is more of a direct approach than other combos and  
should be used if your opponent chooses to tech and build air units.  
This will probably be a more popular choice than other Hydralisk combos,
  mainly because it occurs when your opponent techs to air. Hydralisks  
are more useful against armored units, which consists of the Terran’s  
most common air unit, the Viking. Hydralisks will also be used to  
support against ground units.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Against other Races</h2>
<p><strong>Vs Protoss</strong>: Hydralisks combined with Zerglings or 
Roaches are a great counter to Zealot / Stalker combos and overall work 
very well against almost any unit combination. Hydralisks are also the 
best counter to Void Rays, if you see that your opponent is massing Void
 Rays then quickly producing Hydralisks will be the best bet. You can 
always go Corruptors against Void Rays although this leave you with out a
 ground attacking unit and Hydra’s are very strong against Void Rays so 
they are the best way to go.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Terran</strong>: Against Terran Hydralisks work well but 
must be paired again with either Roaches or Zerglings since Stimed 
Marauders can can take them out pretty quickly and Siege Tanks love to 
tear apart groups of Hydralisks unless you can get some units close 
enough to focus fire them down. Hydralisks are the best counter to 
Banshee rushes, a lot of players like to get cloaked Banshees and having
 a Overseer and a couple Hydralisks will be the best counter to any type
 of Banshee build or rush.</p>
<p><strong>Vs Zerg</strong>: Hydralisk work great when playing against 
other Zerg players, if you have enough of them they can take out 
Zerglings rather quickly and grouped with Zerglings are great against 
Roaches. A lot of players like to go Zergling to Mutalisks and the best 
way to counter this is massing Hydralisks, they will be the best counter
 Mutalisks and you can use Zergligns to harass their base while 
protecting yours.</p>
